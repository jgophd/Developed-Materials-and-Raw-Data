Joshua Waller interview

Hi, yeah, thank you. Yeah, thanks for having me. Yeah, I'm Joshua. I'm a developer advocate, and DAP developer for follow. So I help build out the follow world palette for that's like, integrated into the color pair chain now, so helps integrate remarks like NFT palette into the follow up palette as well. And then also, I, I build decentralized apps on fat contracts. And from there, I also teach and help out others, as I travel, like kind of like around the world to like, kind of teach these fat contracts, seminars and workshops for different developer conferences, just randomly, so I have one at like, the end of the month, that sub zero, so that'd be pretty nice.

01:10
Excellent. So can you can you tell us a little bit about the palette you did? You did with remark and the work you do with that and kind of the functionality in that?

01:20
Yeah. Yeah. So, so kind of like explain remark. First before like going into like the, the integration that we helped remark with, like remark is like an NF T Legos. Essentially, you can have NF T's own NF T's and MCs be equipped with NF T's you can also have non transferable skills, which is really nice that, that can enable things like like Soul bound tokens in general. So that while I can't ever transfer this entity out of its wallet, and use it utilizing like, creating like a palette that people the other pair chains and other like substrate based chains can integrate into their runtime, it makes it really powerful that now you have like these modular and have T's and you can create some different custom logic. So for instance, for like, follow weld and are like contributions to remark, we're able to help them build out their like core functionality. So this core functionality right now, as it is, you can, you can have your NF Ts, and then you can mint an NF T into an NF t like during the minting process, which is is good for things like like, like in follow world for us, we have this concept of a shell NFT that's able to be composed of all these different shell parts so that you can one you can make your shell and then whenever you're minting all the shell parts that are going to be owned by this like, like base shell part, you can mint them directly into that NF t so so the NFT ends up becoming like a direct like you derive a like public key, a public key from that NF t so that you can actually own all the NF T's under it. So this kind of like opens up like a lot of possibilities that you can't do today within our tos. And

03:23
yeah, it's, it's I mean,

03:27
there's, there's a lot more that goes into it, but that's just kind of like the beginning parts that we've like, helped them with their like core functionality. Okay.

03:36
And I've seen I've seen where or Zoe mentioned something about the concept of dynamic soul bound tokens.

03:46
Yes. So like are like for the follow world. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, to explain that. So, so, since we have since now, these remarking FTEs can be non transferable. We call this involve world spirit NF team and the spirit in ft is also connected to your decentralized identity like my crypto profile which is done by linden tree and this is like a decentralized identity like data aggregator from all of your accounts that you have connected in that my crypto profile so for instance, you can have your your binance wallet, you can have your Aetherium wallet, you can have your Kala and follow wallet addresses added to this micro profile for your like what three interactions with follow network in general. And then you have your your web two aspects of accounts. So like your discord, your Twitter, your GitHub, your like Falah forum account as well. And this This also allows us to aggregate data and from there and this is all like, like privacy preserved through linden trees like, secure on claim like technology, I don't know too much about it. But we're able to combine that with the non transferable spirit NFT. So that we can aggregate all that data in and then configure for, like, attribute scores that directly reflect your contributions and your involvement with all the network. So if you're like a developer and you contribute to our code base, then you'll have like, one of the attributes, we'll have a higher score for that along with like mining, staking trading, in general, like trading the follow token, because we have a follow token on Aetherium. And we have a file token on polka dot and Kusama with our pair chains. So you can you can also route those tokens between both like the Etherion network and polka dot and Kusama networks through a sub bridge. So that's like, one thing that we can aggregate data from another is like, Are you promoting on Twitter? Are you promoting on Discord? Like are you an ambassador, so that's gives them more of a higher score for a different attribute that we have as well. So it really it's, it turns into more of like a play to build model so that you can really generate like a true like spirit and as like something that is tied to your to all your like what two and what three accounts. So then it's an actual soul. So like, say you do lose the spirit and fit well, you won't lose your microprofile that's connected to all your different accounts. So then you can just mention other spirit and you won't lose all of your like all of your scores. And you can like go through some dispute to say like someone hacked his wallet and you don't want to like have that information on your microprofile. Now,

06:46
for this little the linden tree, collab collaboration, can you expand on like, what, what what they're doing, what you're doing with them? And what that project is all about?

06:56
Yeah, I don't I mean, all I know is that they're like a decentralized identity data aggregation protocol. So So that's, that's how we were able to use that data meaningfully to create that soul that soul bound data like that will be tied to your, your spirit and team. So the partnership, like they have their their own other like other projects and other partnerships that they have. So I don't know too much like too deep into the like the specifics of what they're doing. Other than that, we're using their decentralized identity, like data aggregation.

07:30
Okay. Okay.

07:32
Now, whenever we're talking about the dynamic SBTs, is that like, the whole soul balance? 2.0? Or just something totally

07:39
different? Yeah, that's it.

07:41
Okay. All right. So

07:45
going back to going back to the original, the original discussion we had before we started recording, what digital inheritance?

07:56
How do you think that can be integrated with what you're doing? What you are doing it at at follow? In follow world? Do you think that could be integrated in some way?

08:10
Yeah, I think it can. And I think, like, in my mind, I would just do it through like fat contracts, whenever they're enabled on our main net, because the fat contracts, one, you can derive public key pairs for different chains, and say that you want to do some kind of inheritance, right? Well, then you derive a key pair that that never reveals the private key. And then you set up some access control features, so that you would be able to say, um, I want this account and this account in this account, to be able to access this function. And if this function is like something that can change the contract, then it would release something like a private key so that they can access the wallet or would send the funds directly to them that they can access. So there's like different like things that you can configure with the fat contract to be able to do that for for you to have like, some kind of like digital inheritance, or you could like bury some treasure or something like that, too, is because like it's a and and the cool thing is like, since you can derive those those like those key pairs, within the Secure Enclave, then you can have it for different chains. So you can have like different different tokens from different blockchains in the defect contract. And from there, that's how you're able to like, oh, well, based on if this person, like calls this function, then I'll trigger a transaction and send it send it to the wallet that we think that they would own and then you can have like some kind of like digital inheritance there. But I am interested though, in how it's There's like, enforced that at the at the appellate level, which would be really interesting because like a social recovery palette, then you can have that integrated in all the like substrate base chain runtimes. And I wonder how that, like, I do wonder how that would work because like the fat contract idea that I was thinking that I think of is like, kind of like a little siloed towards like one solution. I'd wonder how to like do it like more of a decentralized way to the power integration, though. Yeah, you're doing

10:29
that. Can you expand on what a fat contract is?

10:33
Yeah. Oh, yeah. A fat contract is a like, let's see. So that contract is not a smart contract. It's a it's more of like a smart contract enabler. Because we're we're like follow network operates on this secure option computation model, which utilizes like secure enclaves in these off chain workers to be able to one pass messages back and forth between the follow up blockchain so that so there's like this, this message, real air that we call like a fairy, but and then you have your like, follow blockchain. And then you have your Secure Enclave off chain workers, and they can pass messages back and forth. So all these options and workers are also in sync with the follow blockchain and they're all separated into different clusters. And these fat contracts are, are deployed within these like off chain Secure Enclave workers. So since they're off chain workers, now you have like, the ability to one scale your computation to you can have like instantaneous queries, since they're in sync with the blockchain for the Fall blockchain. So like, this is really important, because since you can have, like no latency with your queries, you can do a lot more with them. So since they're off chain, we also have access to the internet. So this access to the internet allows us to make like HTTPS requests. And there that means you can like interact with web two or what three services. So it becomes like more of like a middleware like this, like glue that you need to build, like, what three applications or like hybrid web two web three applications. So it's like a, it's like the perfect like, ingredients for like the web 2.5 to get get us to like the next step of like, what 3d development? At least that's how I see it.

12:33
Hmm, excellent. Can you talk about the roll ups we

12:38
discussed or that's, that's just that's to be done.

12:42
I mean, it'll be it'll be to describe more, I would like to be able to like, understand it a little bit more to explain it like technically better, but essentially, since we have these, like, Secure Enclave off chain workers, so we have this like privacy preserving aspect. Now we can, we've already proved this on Aetherium, and all substrate base chains, but we can derive a key pair within the Secure Enclave, or the fat contract, we can then compose an extrinsic. And with that, that key pair, we can sign the extrinsic and then send it to an RPC node, so that we can execute a transaction. So the roll up part is we need like, like, if it's like a theorem, we would have to deploy like a layer one roll up contract. So that we can ensure that the state of a transaction and and then the neck, like that's where I get like a little little cloudy on like the technical like, like, specifics of that part. Because I'm not I'm not like 100% sure how to explain that correctly. But it's, it's a way for us to like ensure that transactions will go through and we can not like continuously send transactions from our like, like from a cluster of off chain workers. So it doesn't try to like execute a transaction again, or some something like that. So like, that's the part where I'm not really clear on it. I'm trying to get like a little bit. A better understanding on that. But you also saw that that's one part where you can deploy this off chain roll up, contract on the layer ones, and then there's also the substrate base. So like creating a off chain of roll up pallet so that we can interact with all like substrate base chains and make make sure transactions execute on any substrate base chain through the through the fat contract. So that's like the other aspect as well.

14:41
Now, another thing we started to talk about was if someone wanted to create

14:47
a digital inheritance type solution from another from another blockchain, we were talking about how that would be how that would be how that will be included in a pair thread and if it would really lead to be included. To the pair of three, do you have any kind of any further thoughts on that one?

15:03
Yeah, that one. Like, that one's really interesting, because I'm not sure how, like, how to enforce it, per se, but like, sit because just you had mentioned like, a parent that, in general is like a pay as you go model. And it does make sense, especially if you're, if this is like an inheritance type of contract, cuz you're not, you're not going to have a, like, not contract, but like, like, a pallet model, right? And the social recovery pallet. So if you're able to, like claim your inheritance, it's not going to happen often. So like using a pair that for this seems like a, like, a pretty good idea. Because it shouldn't be happening often. But I don't like it's like, really hard for me to like, like, think of like, how exactly to do that, such that

16:00
such as, like,

16:06
you can ensure that no one can like fake any kind of like claim on an inheritance. That's where I'm like, like hat, like, in my mind is like, how do you break? How do you break that like idea by using like, these pair threads are? In general, like, what is the best way to protect your like inheritance in general. And that's where I'm like, that's where I'm stuck on. I'm like, I really want to know, like a little bit more like on the on the social recovery palette and like the whole, like architecture that you plan to do. Yeah, makes me think a lot. I'm like, but it's such a great idea, like in general and just being able to

16:48
recharge my brain. Yeah. It's all theory at this at this point in time. Yeah.

17:00
And you said you were talking about like the, what was the the project you're talking about, like that?

17:06
Safe Haven, safe havens? Safe havens on V chain.

17:10
Okay, and how did they How did they do this?

17:13
They just been on V chain, there's no integration, no integration, right now they're just on V chain. So again, they have a wallet where you can actually so you'll have like signatories. And then you can actually set up a kind of like kind of like a digital wheel. Okay, like digital will and testament. So that's kind of where that's kind of where the social recovery palette, I think could be a good use case within the polka dot and Kusama ecosystems where you can kind of set up something like that with a social recovery palette. Similar to what they currently have now.

17:42
Exactly, yeah, that's why I was thinking is like if you do it at the power level, then then once you have that, that palette finished and and it works and you can test it out then it's not you don't even really need a pair third, you just then other pair chains and substrate based changes that can just integrate it into their runtime and now they have so

18:03
so it's kind of like what you would what you what you all do what remark remark created the creator, the NFT solution, and then pretty much any any substrate base chain can integrate what remark created.

18:13
Exactly, yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah, that's where I was like, I was like, Yeah, I don't think you need a parasite, I think I think you just need to build the palette and then and then have other pair chains like integrate it and then if you create some kind of way to say, Oh, if you if you want to create some kind of solution where it's like all these different chains need a signature from this chain, you need a signature in this chain, you need a signature from this chain, then you can use like maybe like FCM like messages to be able to like communicate between that pallet across different chains. So that you can like, like, recover whatever like like when it comes to like social recovery, like, like be able to like use like some kind of a C multi account like signature scheme to be able to

19:03
say yes, this is good. This is good. This is good. This is good. Alright, so how could that

19:06
be one one sees Wow, this route was trying

19:11
to get one How could there be an aggregator? How could there be an aggregator within the polka dot and Kusama polka dot and Kusama ecosystems right? That should be the easy part and then to How could there be an aggregator across Aetherium phantom finance right because you have to aggregate not just not just polka dot because you have to bring in polka dot Are you ever bringing Kusama the guy bringing in Aetherium by Nance, Polygon, optimism,

19:43
everybody

19:45
how will that how do you think that would work? I'm not gonna ask you how it works because how you think off the top of your head.

19:50
Um, there would have to be because I mean you have to

19:54
do all my individually or something.

19:56
I think it's like a It's like using, like, for instance, like with the sub bridge, we're able to like, move.

20:07
Which explained sub bridge.

20:09
Yeah, so sub bridge is, it's like a combination of Chain Bridge by chain safe. And our FCM router that we developed in house. So pretty much, you can take an EVM base chains token, like if it's follow right now, right now it's just like the follow token that we support, it can go into the Chain Bridge, it goes to here, and then it gets to our FCM router and Raxiom router wraps that into an axiom message. So that whichever chain we have, like open hnrnp channel with right now, we can route that token over to their chain, like so it's like a, like a combination of the technologies. So that's why I was like saying, like, it could be interesting like to connect different chains through some kind of bridging technology and then wrapping an axiom message, or there's like, an agreement between the two chains that understands FCM messages in general, which, which would be like a, I think would be better, but I don't, it's really hard to like say, like, how to integrate all the different chains without any kind of security holes because of like bridging in this kind of vulnerable.

21:25
Current state very vulnerable.

21:28
But yeah, I mean, potentially, potentially, you could just use a fat contract to like do that bridging? Because like, because the fat contracts are pretty much. No bridgeless like cross chain transaction. So you don't even have to use it. But you skip the bridging part

21:48
of that contract. Huh? The fat contract? Yeah. So do you think so you think that contract could actually great the aggregation with polka dot and Kusama? And then do the communications? Did a communication? It's like Aetherium,

22:05
Polygon, optimism, bond and smart chain.

22:11
But then what would happen? It would it would come back. So you would send out the message to all those blockchains. And it would come back to polka.or. It would be like a centralized hub. I'm just asking. I'm just thinking through this as we're talking through it.

22:25
No, yeah, I'm thinking through it too. Because like, it's an interesting problem. Because if you could just interact, like say, you have a you have a bunch of I would have to think about this a little bit more. But the fat contract in general can communicate with all right, so all the different chains, so it'd be a matter of like, first signal, maybe like choosing one of like, go into like your accounts on these different changes and like sending an adaptation of like, my account was compromised, I need to recover it or somebody like starts like a in like a claim on an inheritance. And it starts the process in that sense. And that sends like a Nexium message to the fat contract, then that triggers something that would send to all the different chains for Yeah, I don't know, I don't know if that's a good design. No, I had to really, really, really think about this and right map it out.

23:35
Because it's like, it's almost like it's almost like all this stuff would have to be set up in a social recovery palette, right? Because he was going to be initiating a social recovery palette and then I guess the fat contract would initiate it and send out send out those messages I'm asking for I have no idea

23:53
you could have like some kind of like

23:59
you could have the the fat contract configure to be polling to query that social recovery palette for the different chains. But I don't know if that's like an efficient solution. So it's like because then it like yeah, I don't know if it's an efficient solution that I really got to think about this social recovery like a little deeper because there's so many ways to attack it, like attack the problem and then it's like okay, well we did this way is that too many steps to get to the inheritance or the social recovery like how many steps because if you do too many steps, then it could get out of whack from one of those steps. And you want to make it as simple as possible for people to for chains to integrate and then have a flexibility of ensuring that they actually get their their their claim recovered or whichever.

25:02
And then it's almost like okay, if that if we're going to be calling all these blockchains.

25:08
Add, which ones are going to be omitted?

25:11
Yeah, well, I guess that's where you would, you'd have to create, like some kind of threshold like signature scheme on that. Because it because like, I always thought that, like for social recovery, you, you just need to have some kind of threshold mechanism to where if you're sending out a claim that you lost access to this wallet. And these funds, one, you had to ensure that you can freeze it, I don't know how you would freeze the funds or freeze that account from like moving stuff out. That's the hard part, right there. And then two is what like, how do you ensure that someone doesn't steal like, the, like threshold count of accounts that you own? Like, an because like, if you if you want to do like a social recovery? I would think in my mind, I would think that you wouldn't want the person that has compromised one wallet to know that they can go to that social recovery palette on another chain and then view on the council. Yeah.

26:24
It's now you're having access to check every single block every single chain.

26:29
That's a good point. Demonstrated point. But I guess,

26:34
maybe that's where like, maybe like, if you talk to like, like some of the zero knowledge chains, maybe they they would have like a, like an interesting, like, take on it maybe like people, maybe the people from Manta, they might know something, potentially. That's where I was thinking like the fat contracts too, because like the fat contracts are privacy preserving. But I don't, it's like you have to have it in practice for you to know like, if it's going to be like vulnerable. Right? That's like the only scary part. Well, I guess like scary part is like getting hacked first and then the recovery part but or having an inheritance that someone wants to get


29:41
what I see is like safe ID safe key for multi two factor multi factor authentication interesting and they're interested in and looking at building on top of polka dot Yeah. They should. I mean, this is kind of like all the stuff that I'm seeing on their site is something that's,

do that?

31:01
Well, it depends like what where you're building if you're building on father. So like, our model is pretty much going to be Stake your father tokens behind this cluster of, of workers that you think is going to serve your computational needs. And then once you're staking, you get a percentage based on how much you stake of that computation cluster. And the only the only thing after that, that you pay is transactions fees, if you do any transactions, but we kind of encourage people to use the queries because the queries are is are instantaneous, and you can kind of like, make transactions on different chains to the query. So you don't have to pay any, like by transaction fees, with the follow token doing that. But like if say, say that you're done, like you're like, Okay, well, we don't really want to, we don't want to use this computation anymore. Maybe, maybe we test it out and we don't like it. Or maybe they want to move to a different cluster than they can just unstable. And on SEC their token. So it's really like, like no cost.


32:51
Yeah. But it's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Goes by fat. Like I like I remember last year, like, at this time was whenever I was like doing the hackathon for father trying to like get a job and find a place in blockchain. So it's like, yeah, all like, but all the stuff I know now compared to them, like, I didn't know anything, then. And then even then I was like, since the like, a few months before, I didn't know anything and I knew a lot then it's like, you just keep compounding, like, all the knowledge you get. And then I think about onboarding students or onboarding, like people that are in traditional, like, what to backgrounds? Like, it's such a huge, like, knowledge gap, I guess. Because you have to one you have to know about blockchain technology, understand blockchains and cryptocurrencies, then you also have to understand distributed systems. So there's like this, like, it's very rare for, for you to get two of those. And whenever I came in, I was like, I kind of knew a little bit about like, distributed systems. I didn't know anything about cryptography, really. So it was like,


35:49
I think we got I think we have enough. I think we have enough to look at when you look at V chain, need to see a V chain needs to see a B chain can see if there's value in V chain. So you think it'd be it would be easier for Vicente to do a layer layer two as compared to a pair chain?

36:05
Yeah, I mean, if they don't want to, like handle, like tokenomics and like running a bunch of like, just building like a blockchain essentially. Yeah. But if they want to build their own blockchain, and then be able to interoperate with all the different chains, like from their chain use, like FCM, message passing?

36:26
Maybe. But I think I think they could be a layer two. But just

36:35
because they're good, they're gonna they say, if they were to do something like this, they would have to use that contract. Right? You think



36:47
they use connais? Today, to develop a solution without back contracts and just uses social recovery verbally?

36:54
They could, they could, because because in the social recovery palette is something that you just integrate into a runtime. So it could be a solution that they could just do pallet development, and not have to worry about the like, like token anomic model, and they can offer these security palettes as like, as a service for other para chains to integrate into their runtime. So that's another option too.

37:19
But what's the what's the value of them integrating back contracts?

37:23
It's quicker development. It's like It's like writing smart contracts. But like with more power, gotcha. Especially with like the access to the internet. So they would probably like obviously, they have like some really good like products right now. And I'm sure that they would know how to, to utilize like, utilize the one like privacy, privacy preserving aspect of your, of the like Secure Enclave. And also like having access to the internet, and being able to make cross chain transactions and interact with decentralized storage or any kind of like, the ways to like connect with whatever service they need that's off chain. So they have like access to all off chain. Like technology if they needed.

38:12
Can you explain a Secure Enclave because you making it a bunch of times?

38:15
Oh, yeah, so like, right now we like support like Intel SGX x. So it's like, think of it as like a black box on a chip. And we utilize this to be able to one like generate a proof to get like all the like hardware, the firmware, the software running on your on your node. And then that is signed by like a key within this like black box that is like, right now it's like Intel. So Intel, like there's like a signing key. And then there's a sealing key that like Intel doesn't know about. But the signing key, you're able to sign this like we call it they call at a station quote with your like hardware BIOS firmware, your software version, sign it with that signing key, send it to the remote Intel adaptation service so they can one verify your quote and that once they verify and sign it, that's going to say like, Okay, this is a visit a trusted person to run a like a miner on follow. So that's like one aspect and the next aspect is whenever you're executing a program, it'll generate a Secure Enclave. So that that your execution state will go all the way through without anybody any untrusted source outside of that Secure Enclave peeking inside and seeing the contents of that execution. But the proof will can come out and then be verified by anybody that's outside of the Enclave but they can't see the contents or what was executed within it. There's there's there's also like, like a lot of people will will say like, oh well what about like side channel attacks and stuff like that. But it's like bit like the way our like architecture, texture is it's a, that's like a really, really difficult thing to do. And to target a specific miner for a specific contract through indianic Encrypted like communication. Like it's like pretty, pretty infeasible. And a lot of them like require, like, you know, replays, like replay attacks or like, kind of like, just like, I think it's like, like the electrical. It's like, that part is like, I don't know how to exactly do it, but it's like, really, really infeasible to do the way that you would really need to attack is like to find the exploit that destroys all Intel sex, and then we'd have to like, because like, right now we're trying to support like AMD sav and arm trust zone and other like, secure enclaves. But just kind of like expand the protocol for like decentralization purposes but right now it's like it's that's like what some people that kind of like, what about this? And it's, it's not really feasible right now,

Interviews with Tyler Doussan of SafeHaven

I try to fold as close as I can. But I know I've seen some of your your comments in your posts. And it's pretty exciting. So I'm anxious, you know, as an investor to obviously that another reason we follow you, but I'm excited with all the new stuff that I know, you were like, you probably can't discuss everything but everything that you can I know everyone else following this channel as well as excited to so.

02:27
But yeah, I'll say this, um, yesterday, that message that we got from Red per sec, who are the people auditing? Well, the C swab, smart contracts for the atomic swapping, they said all the feedback, feedback is good so far, and we'll be able to get the full results in a little while. So I don't want to put a timeframe on it. It's really, really soon. So that last remarks good. Whenever we get a remark like that, we know that we're rounding third base right. Now, one thing that's exciting for I know, your community, and specifically is onboarding additional chains to say swap. And we've been recently looking at seeing if we can do that for XR, Pl projects? And the answer is everything's possible. It's just gonna take a little bit of time, but we feel that we have the right tools to be able to make it happen quicker than some think. Because yeah, so um, EVM base chains are going to be easier to add. Those are going to be quickest, So we're going to be working on adding some other EVM chains before we start branching out to some non-EVM chains. But XR PL is right on the top of our list forum. Chains better out of the EVM reach what somewhat. Yeah.

04:12
Are you allowed to go into the patent at all? Or not at all? I mean, obviously don't go too much. But as far as like the updates with that, because I know that's something we've shared as well and I think it's pretty big deal. Yeah, so

04:26
um, it's been fully granted the fees have been paid, that was the only thing holding it back and it was just a matter of us just having a follow the fees and just just pay it right. It takes a little bit of time to get those documents settled. Especially whenever you're working from multiple different regions, right, because the founders are from Belgium and in what not so USA different. Yeah, so But um, everything's approved and everything's 100% protected and in the USA as far as the intellectual property goes. And Europe is almost fully granted, we just got done, I'm singling down to the last couple selections, because here's the deal. There's, there's like 27 different areas where you can get the claim filed within Europe. But we're only going to be targeting like, five, maybe seven, let me get the exact number right in between five and seven different countries for getting fully registered. So once we have that paperwork fully filed with the, um, the fees will be fully granted. But the intention to grant is there. So with that technically means is that everything's protected, even though we're still going through the final phase. But the US is fully done. So,

05:51
wow, that's a pretty big deal. I think too. You know, basically, for a lot of the new viewers, basically the, you know, the safe haven has like the safe swap. And it's like a trustless decentralized atomic swap protocol. And I think the big thing too, a lot of people don't realize with the safe haven is, you know, the capability for what's it what's the inheritance or something? How do you pronounce that? Yes.

06:18
Yes. Inherit t you said it perfectly. Yeah. And

06:22
that's like, where like it protects? You can, you know, pass it down generational? Do you mind going into that just a little bit for like the new viewers,








06:31
of course, 100%. So I've actually got a safety device with me. Now. There we go. So this safety device right here, it stores the plan shares created whenever you create a decentralized inheritance or Personal Backup plan. And how does that process work? So you go to inherit t.com. And you sign in with the safe ID account. That's essentially your account to asset access all of our product platforms. And after you log in, and you select the the Family Circle plan, which is our Community Edition, you'll be able to start filling out all the plan details, and who's going to be receiving the inheritable data. And all that data that you type in there, such as phrases to get the wallets such as like on recovering them, right, and accessing exchange accounts. So login credentials, username and password. And it could even be like food recipes or trade secrets, formulas, stuff like stuff like that. But all that data, it gets encrypted utilizing military grade encryption. And for those who want to know what type of encryption that is, that's SHA 256. So after it gets encrypted, it gets fragmented split into multiple different shares. And that's basically this secure share distribution protocol. That's the intellectual property being patented and protected, right. So after it gets split into multiple different shares, what happens is, most of the plant shares get stored on these cold storage devices. And they're pincode protected. So each one is going to have a specific thing encode that you have to give to the beneficiary. And when the owner of the state passes away, all the heirs will meet back up. And they're going to meet with the merge authority. So the merge authority is the person in charge of ensuring that all the assets are distributed properly. Because it's important that everybody understands, we don't have anything to do with distributing whatever is involved with that inheritance plan or Personal Backup plan. Because we don't even know its own, there is just a plan like data that gets fragmented and only those who have those plan shares to combine them back and see that that data so that merge authority is going to be responsible for saying, Okay, this area gets this percentage or that percentage, etc. And after all the plan shares are combined between the heirs and the merge authority. There's still one plan shared message. And that's what makes our protocol so safe. That's the validator share, it's on the blockchain. So the only way you can unlock that validator share is by allowing the deadman switch the deadman’s switch to go on answered and the amount of time depends on the owner of estate. So whenever there's some setting up the plan, they can say if they want it to be a matter of days, weeks, months, etc. And once that time passes, that share unlocks all the heirs are going to have to meet back up with the merge authority. And then whenever they go to combine their plant shares again and they each insert their PIN codes because they're PIN protected. They'll be able to combine it with that validated because there'll be a locked in and then they can see all the inheritable data. So they'll be able to use that data in whichever way possible because some people might not even want to use it for backing up mnemonic phrases, they might just want to use it for backing up a really, really secret message or phrase or, or something, right? Like, it doesn't even have to be crypto-related. That's, that's what's so beautiful about our services. It's, it's powered by crypto technology, the blockchain and you have to use the safe haven tokens. It's 10,000 SHA agreed lifetime plan.

10:46
Yeah, that's pretty cool. No question for like, the little, little hardware, how do they get it? And where can they get it?

10:53
Yeah, so you can get these on our website, you go to safe haven, the IO and then in our products, you'll see the safety, and I'm trying to get it, there we go. So it'll come in this box, and make sure that you're getting the fitted two plus SSDP version. Because if we only get the phyllo two version, it's kind of like a UB key. In a sense, it won't allow you to store the plan shares from inherited because that's where the SSDP feature comes into play. So I recommend getting the duo. It comes with two safe keys. So you'll get two boxes. And that way, you know, you'll be able to at least have a good start with two devices, because we do have inheriting mobile coming out soon, which is a very important aspect to our evolution. And I want to briefly go over that. But do you have any more questions about what I said earlier? Because I don't want to,

11:49
um, only thing I think he did extremely well, which is really good with communicating and what's the price? If someone's interested in getting back? The little key?

11:59
Thank you. So um, yeah, it costs about 49. I'm pretty sure that's the price right now. I'm not mistaking 49 For a single and then it's around 79 for a duo. So it's a little bit of a discount whenever you get the duo. That's what I was trying to say. So it's round about 50 bucks for single. And then you get a little bit of a discount whenever you do the duo. Oh, that's good. And as far as the shot taken right now, the current price is at double 03 floating around right there. So it costs 10,000 shot to look and see you're looking at around 30 bucks to set up a plan right now, which isn't much at all.

12:40
No, not at all. That's actually something I was even curious myself. So I'm glad you got into that. Yeah, so 30 bucks, basically to set up a plan 10,000 Shaw, and then the price is 49 for the single on about 79 or so give or take for the duel, which is better overall anyway, and you can just go straight to the website to get one if they're interested.

13:05
Yes, sir, you got it. And these these devices, they could also be used as a video too. So that's like passwordless entry to other type of online platforms that you might want to use it for like Facebook and stuff like that.

13:20
And then one thing, if I understood you correctly, when they're setting up the, like the little life plan, so to speak. Like each member that's involved with that life plan, they each get their like PIN code, if I set it correctly, and if any changes need to be done to that, then everyone who's in that life plan needs to come back and reconnect with their pink code for everyone basically agreeing on the changes to be made, right.

13:48
So that's what's unique about the service, you can't necessarily change the contents within the plan once it's created, not with the lifetime edition, okay, it's all smart contract based. And once those plan shares are separated, and that data is fragmented, you you can only recombine that data as he was there, you can't go in and edit like we don't have any smart contracts like that, available to the platform to where people can re edit within plans. It's just kind of like they make a new plan if they want to with data. Um, so but another feature that we're going to have in the future is the negotiation network to where they could set up subscriptions. And that's going to be when the business and Standard Edition launch and so the subscription based services will allow people to essentially do new plans and update them but they'll have a monthly subscription so will kind of be covered by the Foundation in a sense with the gas for the contracts because remember gas isn't that much when you're talking about V chain or Matic or mar chain and even XR PL for that matter. Y'all have a hefty gas like Aetherium So,

14:56
yes, so it's so minimal. It's like hardly even noticeable yet. No. And it's so quick anyway.

15:02
It's,

15:03
it's crazy. Cool. Yeah, that's the thing. I think. If you've been in any kind of blockchain or any kind of, you know, crypto for a few years, you realize the price of Aetherium is out of control, especially now. You know, we were excited. What was it 3.0 They came out with that we thought was gonna be faster and cheaper. And I, on my end, I don't notice anything different. It's much, if anything I,

15:31
yeah, I don't notice that much of a difference. Honestly. Magic is their best their best approach, in my opinion. And they will save swap, because now we're going to allow all those Aetherium based projects to go to whatever other chain that they want with their utility tokens. And the beautiful part about an ecosystem. When you're talking about a Metaverse in the sense like a NFT game ecosystem, all their NF T's, they could stay on another chain and have their utility tokens go cross chain. And then all they have to do is make it to where their smart contracts allow, essentially, their wallets to be read on one chain to read the NF T's and then use the tokens from another chain to pay for the actual service. It's needed within that metaverse. Right. So it's like hybrid, within a sense, that's what's so cool about smart contracts. Now, I mean, as far as blood gas, you have to pay that that doesn't change that's, that's depending on, on which utility tokens you're going to be using, in a sense, because you have to use a gas infrastructure. But that's what's so exciting about safe swap, because we're going to enable people to come into these cheap gas infrastructure blockchains. Because there's EVM chains out there that do have better gasp easily, V chain being one Matic by that smart chain. So that's, that's going to be the icing on the cake for allowing not only those objects building on Aetherium, to have better scalability and accessibility for their clients, but also to, um, to get more people into the V chain community, and grow that community, as well as all the other communities that are associated with safe swap. Because when a token gets listed, once a swap, they'll be able to have support on all the chains that are supported by safe swap. So they instantly get a lot more exposure. And that's what that's what's good for projects that have products that the utility tokens use for and that's why we created a safe swap to begin with for safe haven. It wasn't even necessarily to serve as all these other projects, which is what it's turning into. And that's great. But it was primarily for us to outreach and branch out to other chains for our products and not be limited to one chain because we have a partnership right now with Matic but we can't have any inherit the smart contracts automatic right now. It's not that we don't have the developers to go them. Yeah, we can code the contracts and get them audited. But what about the token, you got to have the token there, right, the utility token for that. So that's where a safe swap comes into play. Now, people will be able to connect with their wallet, their family wallet, or whichever wallet they want to use, like a meta mask or comment. And they'll be able to swap Shaw tokens like 10,000 Shaw VIP 180 tokens to 10,000 shopmatic base to Wiggins and create an inherited plan automatic.

18:34
Yeah, that's nice. That's nice, because everybody. I mean, I'm a big fan of like, I hate to use diversification because a lot of people say you don't believe in your product. But I think if you flip that around and saying I don't you know, I don't like the idea of maximalism in that sense of diversification. I think it's amazing. But the fact is What's great with the safe swap, is you're going to have people who love their favorite asset. So something like this is great. And this is even, you know, outside of the utility factor, just the fact that as an investment factor, you know, there's going to be boo, you know, get involved, and it's going to get their attention that way as well. But I mean, at the price, again, only 10,000 SHA to even set up this system, and it's like a lifetime system. That's pretty exciting. You know, especially now that you're going to be doing cross chain, that's I think it's going to be a big deal. I don't think a lot of people who are into it just yet realize how big of a deal that is. But I think you know, as we keep moving faster, like this week alone, I mean, Congress, the executive order from the President, all of the International Christine Lagarde, you've got Portugal you've had this stuff going on with Brazil. You've got stuff going on with Russia, Ukraine. There's so much going on. That is live Earlier this week, it's been on steroids it's just speeding up in such a massive way you can feel that pressure and the bottleneck getting ready to explode you know. So I think all of this the timing is is going to be impeccable it's going to be huge for the you know, the safe haven ecosystem there because you got the inherited to the safe swap all your new pants that are you know, now official it's like it's a pretty big deal because I followed where it was really hard you know, at the very beginning, you know, as a provider to find a lot of information on safe haven. But now there's like a lot of stuff coming out with everything but especially you know, Sean, I'm a big fan of that and a big holder so that a lot of people you know, just to bring that up really quick for other investors you know, you can use like the V chain Thor to store like your your safe haven on there as well because a lot of people are constantly messaging me about if I get it where can I store it? So that's another thing too, you know, and you probably know the exchange is just really quick to toss them out the different exchanges better than I would on on what he got it.

21:09
So um, we're wanting to coin were on bit roo were on Emmerich's. Were one. There's a couple more ocean x, of course, I can't believe I've got ocean X, that's

21:28
a crossfire because I use the better as well. Like to get the safe payments.

21:32
I primarily use coo coin. I'm a bit rude. Yes, for the XRP users, we have XRP Baron on bit rue. And that's, that's one of our favorite exchanges. So, um, but as far as I think I'm forgetting. Yeah, so Bitcoin Meester. That's another one. Um, and I think that's, I think that's it, maybe,

22:03
yeah, that's a handful. That's a handful. Because I know we have a lot of listeners, you know, globally as well in a big Asian market over and like the Thailand area. So we have a lot of people who are using the different exchanges all around the world. So it's kind of good that there's like a handful for them to choose from. So that's good.

22:22
In the decentralized exchanges, like Beck's change, or, or V locket, which was previously called Zuma swap,

22:31
but um, and they can still get them there as well.

22:34
Yeah, so there's like liquidity pool in there, people have V chain pair with chai and liquidity pool and then there's liquidity providers, they get a portion of the fees that are provided for for for providing the liquidity. Um, but yeah, there's there's sufficient liquidity that you can go there and swap the chain for shot tokens. So awesome.

22:57
I'll make sure that everyone pays attention to that yeah, I get a lot of messaging on that because I you know, each like know the V chain, I promote that a lot. So the ecosystem I'm always like doing my best to that and you were like the prime person you know, and you've been so like gracious to keep coming on and like having discussions with us. And and then another thing too, once we get going until the new stuff happening this year, maybe closer to the end of the year around fall or something. Maybe we can do this again and have you back on and give us some more updates because I know now people are going to be really interested to follow up with everything that's going on as well.

23:39
Yeah, and we actually just had a recent partnership with an XR PL project universe, they have a really nice NFT community they've been doing awesome, awesome collection of NF T's they've got plans for a lot of different collaborations with other XR PL projects as well, from what I hear, and they've got, like, a rewarding system to where if you hold their their token, then you get AirDrop nfts from the community and their artists. So they've got a lot of interesting things going on. Um, so huge shout out to them. But we are talking to a handful of other x RPL projects that I don't want to get into right right now just because we're kind of sealing the deal on one some things with with them, but we do have one of them that's being announced really soon that that we already came to an agreement with and it's going to be an inherited integration. So really excited about that. They've got a Metaverse, it's Metaverse related, and they've got it and they've got a nice community too. So I'm excited about that.

24:47
My mind I'm already trying to guess who it is. I think I might know but we'll see. I don't want to push you because I know you can't discuss it yet.

24:55
We'll say I'll say this pawn is a good friend of mine. He He's really connected with them. So,

25:02
right, um, I think I have a good idea of who this is. We'll see if I'm right. I'm not going to toss it out there and get anybody in trouble. Yes, yeah.

25:12
You're probably wondering about the nude rewards that are going to be coming from from, say, swap. I know the viewers are probably curious about what's what's going to be coming from the notes in the future. So um,

25:22
yeah, let's dive in. If you've got a few more minutes, if you don't mind. Yeah, I don't mind.

25:26
Um, now there's limited information that I can say because I have to wait until the article does release which is coming soon. But I can give a little bit of insight. So whenever we have listings, like a new token getting listed on Tuesday swap this fees, because we have to set up contracts for him and, and monitor monitor like, certain things or whatnot, right? So anyway, there's going to be a percentage of said fees going towards the new utility reward pool. So every time that a new token gets added, there's going to be a portion rewarded to the note holders. And there's going to be a monthly maintenance fee of some sort for those tokens. So there's going to be reoccurring fees per token. And we it's not going to be too hefty. I don't want people to think that it's going to be crazy rewards like those monthly fees, and those those listing fees, but it adds up. Excuse me, especially whenever you have a lot of partners that need to be on boarded and have the service because when you look 510 years into the future, I mean, look at cryptocurrency in general, I remember just a couple of years ago, it was like 3000 tokens, and then what do we have now like, it's like beyond 12,000 is Yeah. And that's it. So just imagine how many tokens are going to be needing use a swap and how many different small portions of fees are going to visit their utility reward pool. And as a matter of speaking, inherited, whenever plan creation increases, and goes through the roof with inheritance, those rewards are really going to show because 40% of the inherit it, service fee goes towards the near utility reward pool. So um,

27:14
and on your the node is this going to be like, like the regular passive income type know, that people are doing now with like, you know, strong or Phoenix community capital, something like that.

27:26
It's similar, but it's utility based. So okay, with, with those nodes that you just mentioned, they're more so based upon Yes, holding the tokens still and being rewarded based upon a certain amount of nodes that you have right in the in the reward schedule, based upon how many nodes that are active. But ours is based on utility based upon how many on products are utilized, and how many times the client utilize that product. So as they pay for certain services, there's fees that go towards the the node utility or reward pool, and that's contracted in the smart contract. So no human interaction needed. As as a plan gets made, a portion of it is automatically contract is the full and it slowly builds up. And when the rewards are sufficient enough, we do a distribution. Now, we haven't done many distributions, we've only done one for that matter. And I mean, I'm just Yeah, I'm just being open in Ford with it. But that's because we've had a lot of foundational work throughout the last couple of years. But now that foundation is really strong, and we're growing. I mean, we're getting the patents, the partnerships, and when inheriting mobile comes out, people will be able to make a plan on one day. Because even though the safe key is an amazing device and amazing tool, it's also a barrier in a sense, because you have to have the people to order them and wait for the keys to come in. So whenever mobile fully launches, it'll allow people to make their plans in an easier fashion to so will have more utility for inheriting and when negotiated network comes out. People will start being able to store large data, document files or videos and stuff of that nature. So the amount of plans being created will increase as well.

29:14
So is the like, for example, the mobile is that going to be something that will be like a your app store for like Android or for like the Apple App Store.

29:24
Yes, correct. And you'll be able to backup those plans shares on to a safety device, even after you store them on to mobile if you want to. That's going to be so cool about it. Everybody's going to be able to make their plans without having these safeties first. And then they want to fortify their security even further by going cold storage instead of like a hybrid in a sense, because you know, a cell phone, it's hot and cold, depending on whether you have whether you have Airplane Mode on right. So yeah, so if people want to fortify then they can they'll be able to backup their plan shares went to a safety device and then they can wipe them from the mobile device. Nice. So

30:03
and then another thing, before I get too far off on that is the back into the note thing is that's something available now or something that's coming because I know a lot of retail investors, they're hooked on notes like they just want to get more and more and like having with so many different projects.

30:19
Yeah, it's available right now on our nodes. They've been available for over about a couple of years now. I think we're coming on year three. But we have a staking program too. So people who have nodes, they can have better stake in APR within the staking pools. And they take they typically like to stake to build towards getting better on nodes, right? Because it's a four tier system. So the Connect node, it's a million shot that's needed. And that utility reward pool percentage is 3%. So they'll get 3% of the utility reward pool.

31:02
Is there a place like, Do you have a video or something for those people who are watching who want to dive in and just get a shot Nodar also and set one up?

31:12
Unfortunately, we don't have any videos like it's tutorial video or an explainer. But we do have all the information on the website and Okay, perfect. It's on the notes section, it'll it'll show you how many tokens are required, where to download the application to link the keystore of your wallet where you can essentially make those those commands on the blockchain because you're establishing NF t's on the blockchain, when you when you create a node in a sense, that's what's really going down. So like, when you sign the smart contract, it's creating the token ID on the behalf of your wallet address, it gets stored to your wallet. And then our system is able to read the blockchain and see that token ID on your wallet. And then that's where the magic happens. It could see how long it's been on there. And if it's past the maturity process, then it can be a part of the utility rewards. Oh, very cool. Well, it's all on the website. Yeah, it's all there.

32:13
And you're saying about a million shall give or take around $3,000 To get your like initial node set up as well.

32:21
Correct to connect nodes on the million SHA the harbor nodes 2.5 consensus is 10. And the legacy is is 30. And in each one gives a better reward share than the other. So it's 3%, a percent 32. And then 57, or 56. Yeah.

32:41
That's pretty cool. Actually, this was new to me as well. I'm new to the whole node scene. I watched it like happen for, you know, a year and a half, two years with so many people before I delve into that. So even myself as an investor, I'm interested in looking into that as well, which also, that's very cool.

33:00
Well, you're getting in at the perfect time, because like I was saying earlier, there hasn't been that many node rewards yet, because we've been building. But now we're moving into that growth phase. Because everything that we've been building, it's it's getting to the point where it's fully patented. It's scaling into the next layers to where we're getting into easy access, right? And scalability to multiple block chains, not just being limited to one with our products. So we're going full steam ahead.

33:29
Yeah, that's amazing. Good and congrats on the cross chain, the safe swap and all the new patents you have going on. That's pretty exciting. I know the team they're in safe havens very excited as well. Anything else you'd like to discuss or cover before I head out and I appreciate your time so much. Thank you.

33:47
Yeah, I don't want to throw too much out there but I'll leave it with this. It is an exciting thing that everybody's been waiting for more information. We are going to have an official NF T collection. And we're planning on having 10,000 NF T's in that first collection and there's going to be a companion set that goes with that NF T collection and if you have a new then you will be airdropped, one of these companions and you'll be whitelisted to this NFT collection and a brief background huge shout out to Vinos they're doing the artwork for that NFT collection and all the V gnomes are going to have some specific whitelisting capabilities depending on how many they hold and they'll also get some convenience AirDrop so if they hold enough,

34:34
but very cool. There's more information on that on the website and a new section.

34:39
What I'll do is I'm going to connect your website in the description below for a lot of people who are following so the people who are interested on the investing side they can just click on it for more information on how to do the notes. And also for people who are you know looking to do the inherit it. Your information is on there as well. So Though it's kind of be like two birds with one stone that'll be available in the description below for anyone who's watching, you know who's interested on either one of those as an investor or, you know, to secure your information for generations or whatever, whichever one you fit into which category it'll be available. So, and I think that'll make it easier for them as well. I'll just include that on the description below. So

Hi, welcome to tech stocks by OKC podcast. And here we talk about defy game fi Metaverse, crypto and everything else related to them. This is your host James. Hello, everyone. Welcome to O X talks by OKC podcast. And today we have two guests from safe haven. One is Tyler Dawson and he's the Chief Officer of partnerships. And another one is Andy, the technical guru of safe haven. Safe Haven is building defi solutions for safely managing, storing and transferring your crypto or other digital assets like NF T's passwords, pictures and documents. Safe havens solutions include decentralized inheritance, masternode, solutions, wallets and pooling services. So hi, guys, it's nice to have you here on our podcast.

00:53
Hey, James, thank you for having us. And this is Tyler speaking the chief partnership Officer of safe haven. And just to give a little brief, brief background information on myself, I essentially meet with different partnership entities such as NFT, projects, exchanges, and even traditional entities to see how we can integrate our defi products within their platform so that their business and clients can utilize them and, and have all the service features that we have to offer. So I'm gonna let Andy give a brief introduction about himself. And Andy is the CEO of safe haven. And he's also the co founder. So Andy, you want to tell us a little bit about yourself?

01:32
Hi, everyone. Nice to meet you all, is the first time we speak to okay see community. And we are it's a pleasure to do that to present safe haven in a good way. Safe Haven founded in 2017, and your heart building since then, it started with the concept of digital inheritance and in a decentralized way. And it was a very difficult one, because we use a three layer topology. Tyler will speak in detail about later. And also we are starting to go across the cross chain now. And we build a safe swap for it. Because there there are not any atomic swap platform at the moment. So this is a building block that we are needed. Okay, maybe Tyler can go and that was it.

02:24
Great. Thank you. Thank you, Andy. Just a quick question. Well, Andy, you said that you guys serve, you got started with a focus on digital inheritance. So Tyler, maybe you want to talk about that first and see how you guys will came up with this idea and why you think that this is important? Yes, 100%.

02:43
So like Andy was saying, our flagship product is inherited. And this is a decentralized inheritance platform. It allows clients and businesses to go on there, and essentially set up an inheritance plan where a Personal Backup plan. And the way that they do it is they create a safe ID account, which is basically the way that they log into the platform to where they can set up the plan, and even retrieve the plan like beneficiaries retrieve after the home owner, the state passes away. So once they log into the platform, they go in, they input all of their critical data, such as the Manam ik phrases to recover crypto wallets or emails with passwords for centralized accounts, for example, or any other data that they want their beneficiaries to receive. And what happens is, whenever they make that plan, all that data gets encrypted utilizing military grade, AES 256 encryption, and then it gets fragmented split into multiple different plant shares. And depending on how many beneficiaries Yeah, that's how many plant shares get created. And it's pretty unique because let's use an example. So let's say you had three beneficiaries, one merge authority, and, and one set of backup shares on the blockchain. So that would be a total of two plan shares per beneficiary and merge authority and backup share. So that'd be 10 plan shares being created, and then the validator share on the blockchain. So that'd be 11 plan shares total, with that example, on protocols that are patented in the United States and Europe soon to be patented in China. And after all those plant shares gets stored on the safety devices, which are cold storage devices, which allows you to feel safe against quantum computing, once that evolves. Because the majority of all plant shares are called stored. There also pin code protected. So whenever the owner of a state is plugging in it each safety device when they make the plan, they have to press the device and input the PIN code that the A or the beneficiary is going to have to input when they insert a safety device to unlock their plant shares and merge them with everyone else. So that's essentially how all the plant shares work in a nutshell. Now how does the unlocking of data work? So Once the owner of the state passes away, all the beneficiaries will meet with the merge authority. And the merge authority is essentially the person who is in charge of distributing the assets of the estate. Because we do not have any control of the data, the assets are nothing, we just provide the service that allows people to fragment in decentralized data that can be later combined for their heirs to recover that asset later. So continuing on what I was saying, once the owner of a state passes away, and the beneficiaries get with the merge authority, and they plug in their safety devices, and they go back to the inherited platform, to merge shares, so that they can recover that data. And everybody answers, zip encode the plan, share slowly get loaded to the platform. And then once all of them are loaded, the the platform recognizes that there's one plan share missing, and that's the validator share on the blockchain. And when it tries to go retrieve that share, it notices that it's locked by deadman switch. And this is a failsafe precautionary measure that we put in for the users to make things more secure. And the way that it works is when the owner of a state is setting up the plan. Let's say they want a seven day deadman switch where 30 May 30 Day deadman switch than in seven days or 30 days, if they don't respond to the email that is sent to their email account registered with the same ID that created the inheritance plan. Then that validators share unlocks. And all of the beneficiary emerged authority shares can combine with about eight a share to retrieve the digital data, the critical data, that's passwords, genomic phrases, that allows them to gain access to all the assets of the estate. So that's how inheritance works in a nutshell. Now, how are we evolving it? And how's it going to be more user friendly, and the upcoming quarters? So right now, we're talking about safety devices, everybody has to go to the website, they have to order them, it takes a couple of weeks for them to come in. And then they still have to use them, right. So what we're doing next is launching inherit T Mobile, which is actually an application that Andy himself built. And he built the whole inherit T Mobile App. And it's it's flawless, it's beautiful. The only thing that we need to do now is link the API codes, like the routing with the inheriting mobile app to the inherited vote. And the inherited platform itself, like inherited that comm so that everything can communicate with one another. Because what's going to happen here is when a user goes to inherit to.com, to set up their inherited plan, it's going to ask them, Do you want to go with all inheriting mobile, or do you want to use safety and then if they say, I don't want to use inheriting mobile, they click that box, then all of the plan shares are going to be sent to their personalized inherits the vote that's linked to their safe ID account. So then once they download the mobile application, and they tell all their beneficiaries and heirs to download the mobile application, the beneficiaries and heirs will be able to log in with their safe ID accounts that are whitelisted to claim this plan shares, they'll go in there, they'll claim the plan shows they'll give them on their phone. And now the decentralized inheritance plan is set. And you can even have backup plan shares on the blockchain in case of any of the beneficiaries lose one of their devices to where they have to get the backup shares on their device later. So it's going to be a very exciting time for us coming up. And we're going to be doing that. in quarter three, we're hoping to have everything fully launched for inheriting mobile at the latest quarter for but once that happens, it's really going to allow all of our inheriting integrations that we've been making with the partners and platforms to shine, because then we can do marketing campaigns to where it gets people to make plans within a week or within that day. And people can do it because they don't have to wait for a safety they can just download the app and make their plan. But um, that is inherently in a nutshell as far as current state future plans. And the only other thing that I kind of left out with the inherent default is the negotiation network, which won't come into later, possibly even quarter one of the next year. And the negotiation network is the second half of the inherited vault. And what that means is it's going to allow storage of large data files such as documents, videos, photos, whereas the hashey Corp version of inherited vault that's already built for inheriting mobile only stores, small phrases and secrets and passcodes hence the plan shares and all that right. So um, that's going to be nice because then you're talking about being able to have videos inherited by your heirs with the inheritance plan so that you can explain to them hey, you can log into this platform you can access these forming pools, take the liquidity out and liquidate them and live off of that and use that to get your store if you need help or I have in the video to teach them how to further their portfolio and get more diversified and how to enter farming and staking pools and do all that stuff and defy which is really awesome. So that's going to be cool too. But um, what we're going to be talking about a little bit later in this podcast is migrating inherit the contracts to other blockchains to where those communities can utilize our platform on that blockchain and have their validator share stored on the blockchain of their preference, because currently, are inheriting contracts like the smart contracts, they're on V chain or native chain. And we couldn't go to any other blockchain with our smart contracts, as Andy was saying until we came up with some type of cross chain feature. And we didn't want to go cross chain with bridges or rapping, we wanted to go atomic swapping. So there was no platform available atomic swap wise for V chain, there were some there's some atomic swapping platforms out there for other block chains and whatnot, but not exactly for V chain and for the ones that we're targeting, right. So that's why we created se swap to where we can have that capability to be liquid and move like water and access all blockchains that need our products. And what it also allows us to do is leverage the platform that we built to help other platform to help other projects like their tokens and whatnot, go cross chain with atomic swapping platforms, so they could utilize our services and, and make it to where they can have their two can be changed over to any chain that's supported by safe swap. But um, I think that's a lot all in one setting, like talking. So let me see if you have any questions. And

11:43
yeah, I actually have lots of questions. Well, first of all, the inherited it sounds like you're, you're building something that's really exciting and awesome. And it actually got me thinking about planning my future, even though I'm young. But now I started thinking, why should I not think about this, it's a plan, and you don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow. So got me really, really excited. However, I'm in the crypto space. And I kind of understand how the web three system works and all that. However, one of the problems that we have with a lot of services and products on web three is that its ability to go mainstream. So how are you guys dealing with this challenge? And what do you think? How can you make it as mainstream as or as popular as possible?

12:34
Yeah, that's a great question. And we actually have some exciting marketing strategies and discussion right now with a couple of partners relating to inherit T plans and safety devices. And in a nutshell with the, what the plan is, is we're going to be utilizing the community of a large partner that's soon to be announced. They've got over 5 million people within their organization, their community. And we're going to be sending out like newsletters that offer bundles, in a sense, a limited bundle, to where they can purchase that bundle and have two safeties with two NF TS from the other partner that's going to be doing that marketing campaign with us. And that way, whenever the person who's buying the product has been promoted to him, they'll be able to make a decentralized inheritance plan for the NF T's that they're receiving. And they'll also get some tokens from that, um, NF T's Metaverse so that they can go into the metaverse with their newly obtained NF Ts, start playing around and have them protected all at the same time. Because this community, it's full of a bunch of people that are investors, actually, and their business owners. So they're predominantly in the traditional sector, looking to get into the non traditional sector, the crypto sector, and we're going to be educating them on web three, how the products work, and marketing them multiple different NFT products with our safe keys through that type of marketing strategy. That's what we're setting up. So it's going to be very exciting. It's going to allow us to work with multiple different NFT partners on different levels to where while we get awareness for our products, we're also getting awareness for them. And I like those type of marketing strategies because it allows you to become stronger while others become stronger. Because in business, it's not always about making your your company the strongest it's best to group strong with other people because you build a stronger foundation in my opinion. Yeah, that's a great question.

14:58
Yeah, absolutely. You said that partnership is one of the main foundations of growing. And also, you said that you will be conducting lots of marketing campaigns, which is actually awesome. But another thing that you mentioned was the education. As you said, most of the investors who are in traditional investment sector as they are going into crypto direct, there are lots of questions in their minds, and they find it very, very confusing. And with a right type of education, it will be easy for you guys to get them on board. And to let them use your services and products. And through that way, you could get as many users as possible. And that way you will be growing and you the whole web three, space will be growing as well. And I like it very much, actually. And going back to the your answer for the first question of mine, you mentioned about inherited going cross chain and migrating to other blockchains. And you said that there were a few challenges on the way so.

16:11
So the challenges that are going to primarily will, the challenges that we're primarily going to have for migrating the inherited contracts and other chains is getting support for those chains on safe swap, because there's a process there's, there's money involved like fees that that have to be paid to get the chains added to say swap support, because we have to get our devs to make specific contracts and whatnot. But that's the primary barrier. So essentially, if we can get, excuse me, so essentially, if we can get grants from different blockchains that want inherited contracts, on their blockchain to where their clients can protect their assets, and have their validator shares and plans stored on that blockchain, then um, then yet we we can easily migrate the contracts over that blockchain, it's just a matter of having the support of our shot took and on that blockchain to where the actual smart contracts can utilize the SHA two and like our protocols require because every time someone creates an inherited plan, it costs 10,000, SHA tokens, and it's a lifetime plan. So it's good for life. But that's how the protocol is working. And it's set up like that, because we have a whole node system within safe haven. And if you haven't know, then you get a percentage of the utility protocols. So for inherited plans, 40% of the utility rewards. So roughly 3998 Sha after gas is taken out from the contract goes to the utility reward pool for the nodes to share. And you know, we have four different tiers. So connect node harbor node consensus and legacy connect node, they equally share like all mature nodes that have been mature for three months or greater share 3% of that utility reward pool. And it's the same process for the harbor consensus and legacy everyone use matured for three months or greater, like that node in that category, shares their percentages, and the percentages are 8% for the arm Harbor, 32 for the consensus and 57 for the legacy. And yeah, so every product within our products, we actually provide utility reports to our node holders, say swap, for example, since we're talking about that, because that's a contingency of migrating inherited contracts over to the chains. When a new to gain or a new chain is supported on say swap and the listing fees are paid from the listing fee, we take $3,000 In Fiat and put it in, we inject it in the utility reward pool. And then every swap that occurs with that token, I'm on the safe swap platform. There's a small additional fee, for a swap like a very minut small fee, like something that you barely even notice. But 45% of that small minute, minute fee per swap goes to the new utility reward pool, essentially, it will accumulate and we'll use that to market by SHA and then send that market bought shots and you know, utility reward pool. So um, yeah, there's a lot of utility rewarding going on within within our ecosystem. And that's kind of why we have the SHA utility token as the payment mechanism for all their products and services. And why we need the blockchain to be supported on say swap to where the SHA two can can be swapped from V chain over to that blockchain so that the community of OKC can use that. That service, right.

19:41
Yeah, absolutely. I will go back to to how to be nodes in a bit. But let's talk a little bit about safe swap. Well, of course, it has a lot of utilities, but in general, what are other benefits or what other advantages does it have compared to others? other platforms with swaps functions such as you know, multi chain?

20:04
Yeah, great question. So most of multi chain swapping platforms, they're, they're wrapping or bridges in the sense. And it's all linked to contracts that have liquidity backing them and that are susceptible to wormhole attacks, which I don't know if you've seen in the news recently, like in the crypto news, like all the different channels, but um, there's been quite a few of different platforms, getting attacked with wormhole attacks and having liquidity follow through, people lose a lot of money. So there's a lot of dangers involved whenever you implement cross chain technology that's non atomic swapping, essentially. And that's why we felt the need to build our own atomic swapping platform to where we knew it would be bulletproof. Bulletproof and our tokenomics were would remain safe and constant as we provide our products to all the different blockchains that were migrating the contracts to is Yeah, I mean, we didn't really want to rely on someone else's platform or product and our platform, our protocols, our contracts are audited, everything's been validated. So they they thoroughly tested to make sure that no sort of horrible attacks can be incorporated with our atomic swapping contracts. And it's I don't want to say it's an impossible because nothing in the world is impossible at the end of the day, I guess, right. But at the same time with the way that our atomic contracts are set up, it's not susceptible to wormhole attacks. Like it's not something that's technically possible, right? It's only something that can be done with the bridges and like wrapping contracts, in a sense, because within atomic swap, the only way that you can obtain the tokens on the other blockchain is by locking tokens on another blockchain, that's the only way that you're going to be able to get get a hold of those tokens. But yeah, it's it's a great feature, because it's a trustless platform, in a sense, you don't have to rely on liquidity backing it. And it's not susceptible to wearable attacks.

22:14
Yeah, you're talking about atomic swapping. And you're saying that it's very secure compared to other swapping functions with smart contracts and bridging and everything like that. So what do you think, why are other platforms not using atomic swapping?

22:34
Just because it's a hard technology to build. And that takes a long time to develop. Now that we have our contracts develop, it's more so like, for example, to add smart contracts to allow a token to use atomic swapping features to go from the chains that are supported on safe swap currently, that's not complicated. It doesn't take us long for creating those, those contracts. And we can create those pretty quickly. Now, as far as adding a complete blockchain that does take some time that could take anywhere between a week or two weeks, maybe a little bit longer, depending on the type of blockchain it is, but most blockchains that are EVM compatible, it's not that hard for us to get them compatible with the contracts with say swap, it will take maybe one two weeks, right. So that's basically it at the end of the day, but most people aren't. I mean, I hate to say it like that. But most people aren't capable of making the contracts. It took us a very long time to develop them, you can ask our community, a lot of them were upset because it took so long for us to release the platform. Because, you know, we were saying we were going to release it a couple months before it actually got released, but took us a little bit longer to button things up because we wanted to make sure that everything was secured to where nothing could get wormhole, hole attacked and all that stuff. But we're very glad that we did because the platform's successful. We've had over 170 swabs since its launch, which might not sound like a lot, but you got to understand our our products can't live on other chains yet. So there's no need for our users to go to say swap and swap the token yet. The reason why we actually have a lot of swaps is because of Dorney actually, Dhoni is a partner that we on boarded into our product suite. And they're like a education to earn platform. It's like you learn to earn that's their phrase, and it's it's pretty cool. It's like you learn about an ecosystem where a product and then you you obtain x amount of tokens kind of like how Coinbase has their their little things where you watch a video and then you get tested and then you get tokens. But anyway, getting back to the atomic swap and yeah, so we've had we've had a successful launch of the platform all the contracts are bullet bullet proof. That's why white box audited from red for sec. So So yeah,

24:57
yeah, as you said security is one of the main main topics when it comes to web three platforms, and as you're offering your services, you want to make sure that your users, your end users are fully secure. And there won't be any type of attack, where they could end up losing their money. Because if something like that happens, then you lose the trust of the community that you took so long to build. And it's not worth it. So instead, you could take longer time to develop your smart contracts. And then you can let it go online. And through that way, we can make sure that the community is safe from such attacks. And speaking of security, as well, I checked that you guys have distributed virtual hardware security model V HSM infrastructure. And let's talk a little bit more about that. And let's talk about what benefits does it have to the end users or to other developers?

26:00
Yeah, so um, as far as the, as far as that goes, we don't really have that fully out right now. We have the safeties available right now that's capable of storing the plan chairs for inherit tea, and whatnot. But that's more related to the negotiation network side of things for those types of like data storage and whatnot. But the safety devices really, really revolutionary in a sense, it's very similar to a YubiKey, to where you could use it for passwordless entry to online platforms. But it's also capable of storing the secure share distribution protocol plan shares of inherit T. It's an SSDP approved device. And it's utilizing our patented technology that's patented in the US and Europe and China soon to be patented, we're just waiting on a couple more claims to be approved, and then it should go and then we have Hong Kong next on the list with a with some other ones that we're thinking about targeting after that, because we want to make sure that our our intellectual property is protected across the globe, because we're we are international business. And as we roll out those nice marketing campaigns, and we get mass utility with mass revenue rolling in from our products, then we'll be able to start issuing multiple patent requests and any country you can imagine, because then we'll have the funds to be able to just dish out all that because it adds up whenever you try to get patented and trademarked and all that and all the different regions. Those fees are crazy. When you think about the end of the day.

27:42
Yeah, absolutely. It's really expensive. And you need the funds to make sure that you are on top of your game and you are building and building and you're not stopping just because you don't have the funds. And you also during your answer. You said something about safeties? I don't know what that is. What is it?

28:04
Okay, yeah, so safety is a cold storage device, it's very similar to a USB drive. I mean, that's essentially what it is. But it's, it's more than a device to store data, like you can't just plug it in and store a file from Microsoft Word or nothing like that. It's, um, it's a device that's fitted to u2f, secure shared distribution enabled. So it's, it's capable of storing the inherited plan shares, and people need to buy these for their inheritance plans. So let's say you had three beneficiaries and emergency authority, then you need a total of four safety devices, if you want to use all safety devices. And each beneficiary in emergency authority would receive their own device, and they'd have their plan shares on there. And when the owner of the state passes away, everybody gets together and they plug in those devices to unlock their plan shares, merge them, and combine it with the validator share to the DMS is bypassed, and it gets a lot and then they could see all the critical data to get their inheritance plan. That's that's pretty much what the safeties used for but, um, like I was saying earlier, it's, it's also got another feature, because you have to it's a, it's a password list entry. Like, are you familiar with UB keys to where it allows you to go to let's say, Facebook or something and you just click the device and it logs you in without having to use a password or username because you already have all that data inputted within the within the device, like um, we have all that information on our actual website to where you can see the documentation of how to set up the safety once you buy it, and it'll walk you through how to set up this password list information or password list features to where you can even So lob with, with one line exchange accounts if you wanted to, in a sense, because that's got emails and passwords too, right? So you just got to go through the walkthrough and go to the sites that you want to enable the password list entry to and then that's pretty much it.

30:19
So was the Save Key, I don't have to remember the passwords, because that's my problem, actually. And probably, that's a problem for lots of people because you try to use as many and as different passwords as possible in different websites, because you don't want to get hacked, just because you're using the same password everywhere. So it was the same key. Since it's passwordless. I don't have to remember the passwords that I used initially, to log into those websites. And it was the Save Key, I will just have the key on me. And then it will be just fine to use those websites.

30:59
Yeah, that's correct after it's set up. And the only thing that you technically have to remember as a safety holder is the PIN code that's attached to the plan shares being stored on it for inheritance or personal backup plans. Because remember, that's another layer of security that we have, because technically we have like the cloud, the cold storage and the blockchain, right. That's why it's a three layer topology system. And whenever the plan shares are stored for each beneficiary, and the merge authority, you input the PIN code, while you insert the device while you're creating the plan. And then it loads those shares on there. And it locks those shares with that pin code. So when you give that device, that safety device to your beneficiary, like your son, daughter, or the merge authority, your eldest heir, if you want them to be in charge of distributing the estate or lawyer, if you want to hire a lawyer agency, and they input that pin code, when they merge the plan shares to unlock the inheritance Act, the owner of the state dies. And yeah, so that's really the only password in the sense that the owner of the safety would need the PIN code to unlock the shares that are attached to their inheritance or personal backup plans. But as far as all the passwords, that they essentially program to their safety by going through the website with their safety attached, like you essentially go through them through Google, it's like, there's Google tools to where you can go in and, and set it all up. And like I was saying, there's the walkthrough on the website, and they'll show you every step, you just plug it in, you go to the website, and then you type in which usernames and passwords you want to basically put it on it for which platforms and then it's it's pretty simple.

32:46
It sounds really, really essential, honestly, because we have seen lots of hacks on personal accounts or the big platforms such as you know, the other day, I saw a picture where it says the largest attacks, or largest hacks that happened in the NFT space was happening both on Discord, as well as on Twitter as well. Plus in in, in some other social medias, so was the safe key that will be a lot easier to keep them safe, and to keep them out of the hacking and to keep them as safe as possible. So speaking of security, and hacks, so lots of those hacks are going on, both on Discord and other social platforms. What do you think is the reason for that? And how can people stay as secure as possible?

33:43
Well, the primary reason, in my opinion why people are getting hacked on Discord, Twitter telegram is because they get sent this link that tells them hey, you've won some bitcoin. And you've got to go claim it fill out this form to claim your Bitcoin. And it literally asked the person to put in their private keys like their Manam ik phrases at the bottom of the form. But that's how people were getting scammed the most part and it sounds very simple. Like I have average people are in crypto would not fall for that. We'd look at it laugh and be like, okay, yeah, good luck trying to get me to put that in this form, right? This non trusted platform that doesn't have any patented protocols, not with three, right? So, but that's how they're getting people. They're getting people who don't understand the ecosystem yet they're, they're just new into it. It's someone who has some money they want to get into NF T's. They just bought some NF T's and maybe the NF T's moon and then people target those people who have those NF T's. And at the end of the day, they're still newcomers even though they have a NFT that's worth hundreds of 1000s Maybe millions of dollars, right? So that's what it is at the end of the day with the hacking of through Telegram, Twitter discord. And there's also some possibilities to where they send some files that when you open them, it puts a worm or your computer to where it kind of gives them control over it. And if you have your password stored in like just a regular file, it's not encrypted, like, you know, just on your computer and they're able to find it, then that's how people get hacked. Sometimes, um, there's, there's a whole bunch of different ways actually some projects that come out and launch all indexes they, they launched with tokens that have it set up in their contract, where only one wallet is capable of selling that asset, and all other wallets are only able to buy. So after the wallet buys it, they're not able to sell it or nothing. And that's like a scam thing in a way. And that's, that's like, I guess not a hack. But it's something that people need to be aware of. So like, don't be going on decentralized exchanges and buying random tokens that you haven't looked into, especially if you haven't read through the smart contract and look for those type of leaks.

36:00
Yeah, absolutely doing your own research is, is what we say to whoever asks questions about crypto and everything. But at the same time, we don't really tell them how to do like, we don't tell them, hey, you need to look out for scams, you should not click on the links that you don't know. And you should not give your password or phrases, seed phrases or private keys to to websites or to random people, you should not do that. And in most cases, we don't tell them what what not to do. But instead we tell them, Hey, do your own research. So I think the one of the main and important things that we should be doing is educating people by giving them as much examples as possible about potential scams or hacks or whatever. And according to that, give them the lessons that, hey, if something like this happens, then you should not be doing this, this, this, this this, instead, you should be doing that. And that and that lesson through education, we are only able to give them the knowledge of how to protect themselves. Because let's be honest, even if they have like, even if they use a certain, let's say, top security feature the website to buy their tokens or to keep their tokens safe. If they don't know why they should not click on those different scambling. So whatever, they're not going to be safe. In the end, they'll be losing money. And it will be just bad reputation for crypto space and for web three. And, yeah, I certainly believe that by doing their own research, and by learning the lessons that others teach them, then they will be able to be to be safe and to keep their assets safe. Now let's talk a little bit about the current crypto space. And what bear market is, as I keep saying it's one of the best times for developers, because you are saved from all those distractions that's going on all those trends that pop up every day. So you keep your head down. And you you focus on what you think matters. So I just wanted to get some of your idea about this bear market? And what do you think the future holds?

38:28
Yeah, 100% During the bear market, as you said, All projects need to primarily focus on building and staying strong and building and, and not look at the markets are fluctuating and let that stress them out. Nothing like that. And typically, I mean, that's that's exactly what we do at safe haven, we always keep our heads down, we build. And pretty soon we're ready to come out and just show everybody what we've been building and just have some mass adoption. But um, as far as, as far as the bear market goes with other things that we've been doing is setting up an NFT sector for our community. So we're going to have an NF T gaming sector come out that allows the community to use their NF TS from the somatic Oracle's and earn the tokens to upgrade the NF Ts and make them better participate and play to earn tournaments and stuff like that, like as far as the player tournaments and whatnot, but it's something that we're building towards and it's going to enable the economy of the shots ergonomics to be more stable too, because we're going to be adding staking and farming pools for that NFT ecosystem. In other words, if people want to obtain certain NF T's for that ecosystem, whether it's a rare character upgradeable NFT, that allows a character to upgrade, then have to lock X amount of shots or admins for X amount of days, kind of like a steak and then they unlock the NFT. And right now currently, we have over 50 percent of the available circulating shot locked in nodes. So whenever you start adding in more locking protocols, just like the fixed staking program that actually went live yesterday, and it's currently live still, so people can go on the safe node application, which is also an app that Andy built, and goes, take some shots and earn a fixed percentage, like a fixed interest percentage on the month, people who don't have a new, they can enter the non nude staking pool, everybody who has a new they can enter on a staking pool that allows them to stake more shots or a greater return or their interest rates. But um, yeah, I mean, you pretty much said that you have to just keep building during the bear market, you can't let other things distract you. And that's exactly what we've been doing. Everybody within our team has been focused in on their sectors and what they're supposed to be doing. And our technical department has been working on a really, really big Metaverse project that we can't really talk about too much right now. But hopefully, around quarter four, we'll be able to get into more information about that. And it's going to provide utility rewards to our node holders as well. And yeah, it's gonna be a pretty exciting topic.

41:13
Awesome, you gotta keep us updated on that, because sounds like it's something huge, and everyone should know about that. So going back to the question, I just want to ask and these ideas well,

41:24
yeah, during the bear market, as I always say, only project projects with strong film fundamentals will survive. And why is that? Because you need to keep in mind that projects need to have real use cases. If you build something that is not being used, or just an idea that is not attractive enough or not anymore, yeah, then that sort of fell, in my opinion. And also, if you have a real use case project, you need to make sure if it's innovative, that it is patented. And that's why we patented, and healthy as well. So we have all the basics that we need to survive the bear market. We already survived one a few years ago. So yeah, this will be the next one.

42:14
Yeah, absolutely. And you said it right. My last question to you guys is where do you see safe haven in 2024, or 2020s? We?

42:26
Yeah, so um, I see safe haven being a global household name everybody utilizing inherited for decentralized inheritance services. And I see us offering atomic swapping protocols to over 50 different projects when we're talking about 2023. Because that's, that's six months from now. And that's a long time, we've got a lot of projects that are already interested in getting support for, say swab that we're talking to. And it's just going to increase from there. Because as they say, word of mouth increases. And once people recognize a service, that's good, and they want to use it, they're just going to, you know, reach out and then implemented for them as well. So I see us being a powerhouse in crypto defy, providing those decentralized inheritance tools for everybody. And any blockchain that wants to have the contracts migrated over there, they can provide grant opportunities for us to expedite the process. And for those that don't have grant opportunities, it's not that we're going to close them out. But it's not going to be on our high priority, because we have to focus on the ones that we cannot get grant opportunities for first where we can hire additional devs and scale because we can't overpressure our current staff because we we're currently working on developing products. So if we want to scale and add our services to other chains, we're going to need to hire additional loan developers to handle that sector in a sense, that way, we don't spread ourselves too thin. Because it's, you gotta treat it like a like a real organization. You know, as you provide services to a new sector, you need to bring in new employees to manage that sector to where everybody's flowing smoothly and there's nothing missed. But yeah, that's that's kind of where I see us in 2023 being the powerhouse for providing define inheritance, and atomic swapping services.

44:18
Awesome. Awesome. And I hope to see that one day next year and I hope that once you guys become the powerhouse we'll get to have a chance to to sit again and talk more about how you guys came to be such a huge powerhouse and and then we'll we'll be able to celebrate your success. And if there is any developers that's listening to our podcast, you guys heard Tyler's so they have all of their doors open and if you think that you will be able to add some value to the company. I think you're able to get in touch with them and see where it goes.

44:59
Yes So 100% primarily solidity developers, people have a lot of experience with solidity based smart contracts. And additionally, I wanted to touch on one last thing, if you don't mind, James. Yeah, absolutely. So we have another product that everybody's been aware of in the community. But we haven't really talked about our market that much throughout the last year. And that is called funder bias. This is a product that we acquired a little over a year ago. And it's essentially an open source platform that allows a company or a user to outsource smart contract for code dev work via GitHub, to other people for a certain amount of cryptocurrency as payment. That's basically what it is, in a nutshell, if you need a smart contract finish, because your team can't finish the last couple 100 lines, because it's just too difficult for you or you just don't have enough time. Because you have to switch gears and start creating the framework for the next smart contract, right. And then you could go to the platform, once it's live, set up the bid or the the request, in a sense, you would set up the request. And then all developers you know about the platform and who are hungry for work looking for work who have extra time, go put a bid on that request, whoever wins with the bid, like you know, the best bit out of all of them will get the contract to do their request. And then they'll complete the contract via GitHub. Now the smart contracts completed, the company was able to complete their work and get it done at a quick speed. So it allows them to scale at more rapid speeds as well for evolution of their product suite. So I'm fond request is a very exciting product whenever you look at it as a whole. And that is another one that I could see us migrating contracts over to OKC if we have some sort of type of grant opportunities available there, because I know that y'all are trying to do a lot of different building on your blockchain with development. And I think that would be an astounding product for y'all some sweet to where you could open up the capability to allow every body building on your chains to outsource development needs that they can't do themselves.

47:11
Awesome, awesome. Man. I think there is something that we can do about that. And when do you think this platform will be live?

47:19
Yes, the platform is actually ready to go live in a sense, like we tested all the contracts were the requesting and whatnot, on the test net many, many months ago, with test tokens and everything. Everything worked. And we were just waiting for a spacewalk to go live to where shock and go over to on by Nance smart chain because the product was being like well, not was it is it's primarily going to launch on the finance smart chain first, and then we're going to migrate it to other chains that request that product platform for their community of developers to have access to it for their blockchain building. And as far as how long it's going to take, it's just a matter of being able to get a grant to hire an additional dev that can migrate those contracts over that blockchain. That's that's all it is really a matter of a matter of maybe a month or two months to get everything fully worked out. And then maybe another couple of weeks for auditing on that chain, or maybe a month for auditing. Like, that's why I hate throwing dates out there, man, you know, because it's like it, we can get the contracts migrated. And let's say a month, month and a half. But then we want to get everything audited and make sure that everything's you know spick and span just as good as it was with the first setup. And, and that takes time. Sometimes Sometimes the audit can take up to two months, three months. I mean, sometimes they go like two weeks, three weeks, but that's why I don't like giving hard dates. But if I wouldn't, if I had to give an estimate, it probably taken between one to three months if we had the proper on funding to get the platform ready on. Okay.

48:57
Awesome. Yeah, you said it, right. Like if you put a date, a hard date on that. And if there's any hiccup or if something takes longer time, then you will be feeling like he has said that it would be ready in one month, but it's taken two months. And not only you but the community that's waiting for that. They'll be concerned they'll be like, Why is this taking so long? But in the end? Yeah, the I hope that's OKC will be able to help you guys and I hope that you guys be you guys will deploy on on KC and we'll see some some good partnership going on. Thank you for your time, guys. This was a great, great conversation. And it was a pleasure to have you guys here and talk about safe haven and your features and utilities and all that. And again, I hope to see you guys and talk to you guys next year. And celebrate your success together.

49:52
Thank you so much for having us on here today.

Want to learn more about safe haven check out the show notes of this episode thanks for listening stay safe peace

Hey, welcome back to the Rock Cloud Channel, and today we will be doing a deep dive with the Safe Haven project and the S ha crypto currency.
And we're gonna check it all out and get deep.
This is the hidden gem that you guys don't want to miss out on at all.
So pay attention here and let's get some details here and let's get started today.
Thanks for joining me today, bud.
Hey, how y'all doing?
My name's Neal Matrix.
Real name's Tyler Deon, and I'm head of community growth for Safe Haven.
I'd like to tell y'all a little bit about our project and kind of what we do and the services that we provide.
So essentially our flagship prod up is Inherit Tea, and that essentially allows clients to go on there and establish decentralized inheritance or personal backup plans.
And the way that you could do that is, oh, here we go.
He's pulling up right now.
Yeah, so if you come to the inherited platform, you're gonna see two different buttons.
There's gonna be login or register, and it's gonna be the merge that shares.
So essentially whenever you want to create a plan, you log in or register to to Safed, and that's essentially going to be your single sign on account to all platforms like all of our product platforms.
And whenever you have a plan created and you pass away and, and your children wanna get the inheritance plan, they have to press the merge the shares button.
So that, I just wanted to explain that button down there, but yeah, so if you scroll down a little bit.
Okay, there we go.
So this is the family circle and this is our community edition plan.
It's a one time fee of 10,000 Shaw, and it lasts lifetime.
You don't have to pay anymore CHA tokens, nothing.
But yeah, the way that you pay for the plan is with comment.
And that's our, that's our browser extension wallet.
It's similar to Meta Mask, but it's for VIP 180 tokens.
And if you scroll down a little bit more, there we go.
So this is the first part of creating a plan.
You essentially type in the plan name what you want to call it, and you put in the description saying how many beneficiaries, how many beneficiaries there are inside there, maybe who they are and what they're gonna be inheriting to where they could easily recognize which plan they wanna unlock after you pass away.
And the plan notes like the specific ones all the way at the bottom, those are only for you.
Your beneficiaries will not see that.
So those are private notes that you might wanna have for yourself.
Okay.
If you go down to the next slide, you'll see the beneficiary section.
Okay, So here's where you add in your beneficiaries, you'll type in their name and then their email address.
And then you just select each one.
So if you had four beneficiaries and you wanted to have, let's say, one backup share on the blockchain, then you'd go down and select one backup share, amend having any more than a one to three ratio, meaning if you have four beneficiaries, one is the maximum amount of backup shares I'd have on the blockchain, because the more you have one, the blockchain, the less decentralized the plan is because one backup share can replace any one of your beneficiary safe keys or their plan shares on their Inherit T mobile application.
Because right now we're working on inheriting mobile, which is a phone application that's gonna allow errors to log in with their safe ID account, and then claim the plan shares that unlocks the inheritance.
That way they don't have to have a safety device if they don't want to go that route.
But, so the merge authority, that's essentially the person who's in charge of seeing the whole process through, that's the one who has to plug in their safety device first, and they make sure that all of the inheritance is distributed as the owner every state intended.
And we recommend that the merger authority is a lawyer because that's best practice.
You wanna have someone who knows what they're doing, like in the state lawyer, maybe even do further contingencies to where they force your errors to provide a death certificate, burial papers, stuff like that.
So if you scroll down a little bit more.
Okay.
Can you, could you zoom in a little bit for me please?
There we go.
That good?
Yes, that's perfect.
So this has given you an example of the beneficiaries and no backup shares.
And that's a, that's a good setup because if you have two beneficiaries and you don't want any backup shares on the blockchain, I, I wouldn't want anyone there because essentially all that means is someone has to grab one safe key from one of your kids, and then the other one's on the blockchain, and then they could trigger the dead man switch, right?
So it'd be a little bit easier for them to get to the inheritance plan.
But even if they did do that, let's go over the dead man switch.
This is an extra security layer that protects you and your family from having your asset stolen from another person who's trying to do some facetious activities.
So whenever you merge the plan shares and all of them get entered in the dead man switch is triggered.
And that's linked to the validator share stored on the blockchain, which is the final share that's needed to unlock the inheritable data.
And if you look a little bit further below, go down one more slide please.
There we go.
The login activation method and the email activation method.
Okay.
So there's two different ways that you could activate or I guess deny the retrieval of the validator share.
So an email is gonna be sent to you, and if you don't respond to it within a certain amount of time, then that's gonna release the validator share, right?
And then if you don't log into your safe idea account and inside the inherited platform within a certain amount of time, then that's gonna activate the validator share from being released from the blockchain.
Does that make sense?
Totally make sense.
And I like the way it feels very secure to me.
Like the way you're explaining it, it seems to be very well laid out.
In, in the future we might be able to add voice to call or text message, but right now this is, this is what we have to offer as we grow and expand, we're gonna add more features to our platform, of course.
And Got.
It.
I I'll get into those features after we get done with the community edition though.
But yeah, so that's how the Dead Man switch works.
And it kind of sounds ish, but that's, that's the term for it, right?
And then here's where we're gonna get into the fun part.
So there we go.
This is where all the business happens, right?
The inheritable data, This is the data that your heirs need to recover your profit wallets because they're not gonna know how to get into 'em, right?
You gotta recover 'em, you gotta enter in the anomic phrases and then be able to have access to it.
But also one, one important thing that a lot of people forget because there's so many people who get into crypto and they just dive in, right?
And they don't really do that much studying and all that stuff.
But when you transfer assets from a wallet, most of 'em nowadays, you have to have an actual password to enter in with it.
So like the V chain mobile wallet, for example, when you send an asset to another address, you have to type in the trade and password for it.
Well, I'm calling it the trade and password, but it's not even hidden password, It's like a transference password or a signature password.
Because you're essentially allowing access, or not allowing access, but allowing your wallet address to sign the blockchain.
That's, that's exactly what's going on.
But yeah, so the inheritable data, it's whatever you want.
Private keys could be login credentials to centralize and de decentralized exchanges.
And that's really important because you never know whenever you're gonna pass away.
And let's say that you have maybe 10% of your portfolio or 15% of your portfolio put inside a liquidity pool, and then like another 5% in inside this really highly volatile farming pool, right?
Well, you'd want your errors to be able to access those in case if they went astronomical or crazy.
So that's why you need to input that type of stuff too, right?
And it, it could be anything like song lyrics as well.
Okay.
So I guess here you get a summary of everything that you have, right?
Everything over your mods and everything you changed.
Yeah, that's correct.
Everything just a summary.
Right?
Just a summary at the end, and then you get to save you a plan.
And then comment will come up whenever you go to save plan.
And then you'll have to basically do the sign you type in your four digit password to, That's how com gets unlocked.
It's like four digits.
And then it'll reveal your wallet and you're not gonna see your shot tokens in the com display.
They're there, but it is just, you're not gonna see 'em.
That's not how the user interface works for comment.
But you'll see 'em in the top right corner of the inherited platform whenever you logged in.
And it should have a page on that walkthrough that displays that somewhere.
I think it's up top.
Could you scroll all the way back up, please?
There we go.
Okay.
Right there.
You see next to that bell?
Oh yeah.
It shows that someone has X amount of shower on their combo wallet.
So now the person getting control here would also need the comment wallet, right?
Well, the, the person filling out the plan, like the owner of the state, like, like you for example, whenever you fill out your inherit plan, you'd, you'd connect your comment wallet and, and basically sign into it while you're connected to the platform.
Okay.
But the person who's, you know now, you know, you move on, you deceased, and then the person who's trying to get the information and you know the data within, do they also need the comment wallet to start?
No.
Ok.
Okay.
No, they, they don't need your comment wallet or the wallet that set up the plan.
All they need are their safe keys or their plan share stored on their phone and merge 'em.
And that's it.
That's good for making it clear.
Cause I was thinking, you know, that's another step that they need to know.
Makes it easier.
No.
Got it.
Yeah, that's a great question though.
I guess we could talk a little bit about inherit mobile and inherited vault.
I could explain how that's gonna work with our ecosystem.
I kind of touched on it a little bit earlier, but essentially whenever someone creates an inheritance plan, plan shares are created right from the fragmentation.
And whenever you store the plan shares at the end, you have to plug in your safety devices.
Right now with the community edition, whenever the mobile application comes out, you're gonna have the option to essentially store them in a decentralized queue, and they're gonna be sitting there waiting for your beneficiaries to retrieve them.
And the only way that they'll be able to retrieve them is by logging in to the inherited mobile application on their phone with their Safed account.
Then they'll see that there's plan shares waiting for them to claim.
And that's where the inherited vault comes into play.
And there's actually two parts to the inherited vault right now we're only developing the first part for the, for the mobile application award, and that's the Hasi Corp version.
So Hashi Corp is essentially just a way for you to, to safely store specialized text and characters like strings of, of characters.
It's nothing to where you could do large data files or documents or photos or videos, which that's the second version of Inherited Vault.
And that's gonna be the negotiation network version.
But I just wanted to really point that out because I don't want anybody to be disappointed if they hear me say, Oh yeah, inherit two volt's coming out, and then they think videos are gonna be able to be stored with their inheritance plan in like a month or two.
Now it's, it's not coming yet guys, but we're getting there Eventually people are gonna be able to one day store videos, documents, photos with their inherent tea plan, and you never know.
I mean, you could, you could put a video to say, Hey kids, this is how it, how it works, This is what happened.
Or even give 'em some memories of some old times.
Make it a nice video, the sky's and limits with it once we get that part done.
But yeah, that's, that's how two, that's how the both products will work hand in hand together.
The mobile application will pull the, the data from the vault, the Hashi court vault, and it'll all be a decentralized process.
And the only way that the errors will be able to get those plan shares from the vault will be with the PIN code and some other topological security features.
So it's gonna be very interesting and it's gonna help for mass adoption big time, I believe, because it's one less barrier that people are gonna have to do to create a inheritance plan.
So let me ask, with the inherited, is this safe key required or is that just an option?
Like could you tell me about the safe key and you know, where we would need that?
Or are we not up to that point yet in the video?
Yeah, so that's what you need right now.
If you want to create a decentralized inheritance plan or personal backup plan for yourself, you need safe key devices.
You.
Do?
Yeah.
So if you're doing, if you're doing a personal backup plan and, and you just want to have one for yourself, I recommend doing two keys.
Not one, because one key's just, it's just not, not safe enough.
All of it's in one spot.
I, the whole, the whole purpose of our process is to take data, encrypt it fragmented to where it's not centrally stored in one area.
Because think about it, if you just stored on one safety device, it's, it's technically somewhat centralized in a sense.
Yes, you still have to go through the DMS process, but it's only one key that you have to plug in to trigger that it's unsafe.
So I recommend always using two safe keys and have one of 'em store one place another in another spot.
Then whenever you have to recover it, just plug 'em both in, wait for the dms to trigger, and then boom, the inheritable data pops back up.
You got your keys back, and now you can recover your wallets and you got your funds again.
So that's, that's how the safe keys work.
They, they store those plan shares that are encrypted and fragmented and the more, Yeah, but did you have any other questions about the safe key?
No, I didn't have any other questions with the safe key.
I just wanted to get some more information on it to make sure that that is the device that we needed.
It's two one feature.
Oh, that's great.
Actually, this is, now this is interesting to me.
Okay.
So not only can your errors use it to store their plan shares, but they could also use it to log on to any secured online platform.
So, and the plan shares actually stored on this device, Am I right?
Yeah, correct.
Okay, cool.
Yeah, Got it.
Clarify.
You can score multiple plans too.
Got it.
Multiple plans.
So how much space are on these devices, or does that not have concern for what we're doing?
You shouldn't really have too much concern with storing too many plans on a safe key device there.
There's enough space to store multiple plans, and that's why we have the inheritable data dialogue box limited to 500 characters currently, because this safe key device model is, it's not the negotiating network version.
So it has a little bit of a smaller storage, and it's not that it's obsolete or not good, it's, it's perfectly fine.
It could do exactly what you need.
But in the future, whenever we do come out with the negotiating network, if somebody wants to utilize the negotiate network features like the mo like the video storage and stuff like that, that was referring to earlier, then they'd have to go get the new safety devices to do that.
But it still wouldn't destroy their old plans.
All they'd have to do is basically buy the new safety devices to store decentralized videos and whatnot.
Right.
It'd be a different use case, different storage and Right.
Sure.
I guess same use case, but extended features.
Yeah.
But yeah, that's the safe key.
I just wanted to make sure I fully explained that.
There's, there's one section on here that has the, the docs.
Is it all the way at the bottom maybe?
Hm hmm.
Wait, let's see.
Might be right down there up a little bit.
All right.
Safety desktop technical tool.
Go to the safety desktop.
Let's see if that's gonna bring, Okay, yeah, so this is gonna show you the, the user guides and stuff for the safety and the safety desktop and how to do extended features and whatnot.
And yeah, it, it'll basically give you a full in-depth walkthrough of enabling the, the plugin through Google Chrome, like the extensions and whatnot, to, to use the Fido two capabilities of your safe key device.
And there's multiple pages in there, Multiple, multiple pages with pictures and descriptions.
So I recommend that people take time to, to go through that whenever, whenever they can and really understand the product and how it works.
Like there's one feature that you could do with the safety desktop tool that I was mentioning earlier throughout the inherited description.
If you don't want to store any backup plan shares on the blockchain and have all of it cold stored, you could do that, just put zero back up shares on the blockchain whenever you're filling out your plan.
And then after you put all the plan shares on the safety devices, you simply go to the Safety desktop tool, the application, and then you plug in the safe keys that have those plan shares, and then you could back 'em up to a blank safety device.
It doesn't have anything on it.
And then that's essentially your backup.
See what I'm saying?
That's, that's what I recommend.
It's, it's a little more costly, but it's, it's safer.
Nice.
Some people, they might want to go with the blockchain route because, you know, they're a blockchain advocate, but you know, the validator share stored in the blockchain, that's good enough, right?
Well, like what happens if, you know, you change computers and you forget about this tool?
Does this, you know, have any repercussions?
Oh, none.
None whatsoever.
So the backup shares, they're not gonna be on your safety desktop application or the tool itself, it's, it's gonna get put on the other safety device.
So there's a section in the safety desktop tool.
Once you plug in a safe key, it recognizes it, and then you could essentially say backup shares, there'll be a button and you just follow the, the protocols of the application.
And then you just type in the PIN codes.
Because that's another thing that I kind of wanted to mention earlier, but I forgot.
Whenever you get to, to the part where you pay for the plan, after you pay for it and you sign with your common wallet and you plug in the safe keys to start storing the plan shares on each one, you're gonna have to put in a pin code and that pin codes needed by your heirs whenever they merge the plan shares.
So each, each air is gonna have their pin code, so whenever they plug it in, just to unlock their plan shares to merge 'em with everyone else, you gotta know their PIN code.
So it's like another layer of security.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
For sure.
Okay, that's cool.
Good to know.
So that's like one of those other deals.
You gotta make sure your airs never lose their pin code, right?
Right.
But you could make it something that they, they would never forget something easy, maybe like the last four digits of their social and then maybe like two other numbers that are, that are unique to, to them or you in any sequence whatsoever.
Right?
Something like that.
And it's, it's all about repetition.
If, if you have a plan and you go over it with your family and they all understand, then it's gonna be easy.
And whenever there's firmware updates, it's notified to, to the community through our telegram channels.
And we also make a post on Twitter every now and then, and you could see it on the GitHub if, if you ever visit it.
And it'll also tell you on the Safety Desktop tool that there's update available and then go download it.
So, and same thing with the firmware.
If there's ever a firmware update for the safety itself, it'll notify you and it'll say, Please download the firmware update.
And that will not null and void any plan shares that are stored on your safety.
So like, let's say you already had three plans stored on your safety and a new firmware came out, you wouldn't have to worry about those plan shares getting overwritten or wiped or erased because the firmware's, not the firmware updates not, not gonna mess that up.
I just wanted to make people feel comfortable about that.
Safe Swap is a really big product that we're working on right now to further extend our reach for each product in our ecosystem.
It's, it's essentially gonna give us an agnostic approach in the blockchain.
And the way that that's gonna work is it's gonna allow us to swap token contracts for one another.
In a sense, it's not gonna increase the supply of our token or the tokens that utilize our platforms, but it's just like, think of it like this, okay, you have a, you have tokens that can be wrapped, you have tokens that could be swapped to a different tokens where they could utilized on that blockchain, right?
Like b p to b P 20, like b P two to D P 20, like that for example.
So the reason why I'm bringing all this up is we have a product that's important to Binance Smart Chain called fund request.
And fund request is gonna be a platform that developers can essentially set up a bid for other developers to finish building out the smart contracts and any type of code work that's needed for their platform or products that's blockchain related.
And they could essentially designate the amount of tokens that they're gonna pay the user after they complete the word.
Think of it as the five of the blockchain, a place where people can go say, Hey, I'm offering X amount of tokens if you can do this simple task and it's blockchain and smart contract related, which is great because there's no platform on finance smart chain out there like that, that allows developers to get to get together as like a community somewhat and help each other out.
Of course they're gonna be paying each other while doing it, right?
But it, it just allows the ecosystem to advance in many ways because there's many projects out there that are, that are small or startup and they don't have the funding to go pay $125,000 for a smart contractor.
So they could easily just go to front request and say, I've got this smart contract, I've got 25% of it done, I need the other 75% of it done.
This is what needs to happen.
Whoever's skilled and can do it within the amount of time and is finally getting that amount of tokens that's listed, they're gonna do it.
So that, that's why I'm really excited about phone requests for our platform and Safe swaps gonna enable all that to happen.
Because you see Shaw is a v i p 180 token.
It's not a b e P 20 token, which is what it needs to be to run on the finance smart chain and be utilized on the fund request platform.
So that's why Safe Swap is gonna be so detrimental or like so important for our ecosystem for us to port that product.
The biggest important factor that, that people need to realize about Safe Swap, it's, it's not just gonna allow fund requests to get poured to buy Smart Chain, but it can allow us to port any one of our products, of our ecosystem to any chain.
So for example, the other product that we're pour to buy a smart chain has been Block, and that might ring a bell to people who know about Safe Haven, like from the start because there's store block already to where people can essentially go set up crowdfund ICO pooling and a whole bunch of other unique things like, like Kickstarters and Thakur Block only allows v IP 180 tokens.
So like V Chain, Shaw, Hacken, all those v vt H o, but BI block is gonna allow any b e p 20 token to utilize the crowd funding, Kickstarters, fundraisers, ico, pooling, all that, which is huge.
Like I wanted to ask you in terms of the safe key, like how would an end user like myself or basically anybody, how would we get a safe key where, like where do we, where do we get one?
Where do we order one?
Do, can we get it from the website?
Are they not available yet?
Like what's.
Yeah, so you get 'em from the website that you're on right now.
Okay.
And they were actually sold out a little while ago, but we just got some more stock in about five days ago.
Okay.
I was gonna say, I think that's when I, when I was looking at a list I sold, they were outta stock.
And that's what I wanted to ask you about that.
So, Okay, cool.
Yeah, we just got some in stock.
So if, make sure you click the, the ssdp because if you just do the U two F, that's not gonna have the, the ssdp, which is basically your shared distribution protocol, and that's the fragmentation of, well, the encryption and fragmentation of the inheritable data that gets split up into plan shares to be stored on these safety devices.
And the difference between the single and the duo, the single, it's only one safety device and then a duo, it's two.
So it's like a slight discount if you get the duo.
But yeah, it's, it's important that people know that the, the one on the right that's, that has a cheaper price.
It's just one.
So, Got.
It.
If you, now, why, why would we, why do you recommend, you know, the, the package with two over the package with one, you know, a single.
Yeah, so like, I wouldn't use just one safety if you're doing a personal backup plan because I don't, I.
It's basically backup to the backup.
Yeah.
Because okay, if you have one safety device, then that's all you need to initiate the process and trigger the dead man switch.

And it's, it's not that it's unsafe, it's still safe.
You could use one safe key device, but I'd rather make it more safe and have it to where there's two devices required.
That way if someone ever got to my safe key Oh.
I see.
They wouldn't be able to plug it in.
And then you never know because, okay, look.
So, so to make personal, so to make the plan, you know, work or, or to reverse the plan or to get into the plan, you need to, you would need both keys available.
Yeah.
If, if you do two keys, but if you only do one, you just need one key, so, Got it.
Got it.
What I'm getting at is a personal backup plan.
People are gonna want to have it set to where it's hours, right?
Or days not to where it's weeks or months for the dead man switch until the validator share gets released from the blockchain.
Like that's the amount of time that all the errors are gonna have to wait for inheritance, right?


02:25

12:14
Yeah. So first and foremost, let's put everybody's mind at ease and go over the security protocols inherent to him, why you can trust them. So inherently, all the all the protocols of smart contracts, they've been audited by red for sec, and it's proven that we don't track any of the data and none of the inheritable data that's inputted inside that inheritable data dialog box such as Manam ik phrases, or centralized exchange credentials. So none of that data comes to us or any of the other data within the plan. And the way that a person goes about setting up a plan is they create their web to account. So we have a hybrid platform in the sense to where safe ideas or access point to create the plans offered by the inherited platform. So they create their web to safe ID account, username, password, and it's essentially them registering an email address, and we're gonna get to why that's important a little bit later. So once they set up their state by the account, and they log in, right now, we only have the community edition available, which has a lifetime decentralized inheritance or Personal Backup plan. And it costs 10,000 shots. So they click it. And then they go through the full plan, there's a whole bunch of different criteria that they have to fill out, such as the plan name. And that could just be something like, let's say multi chain, wallet, a and COO coin exchange account information, you can have it name that to where when the beneficiaries plug in their safe key to unlock a certain plan, because you can store more than one plan on these devices, they will be able to easily identify and select that when if they want to unlock that one first. So then they have the plan details, which is a description of what is inside that plan. And you could further describe what the plan name is. And then you go further down, and then you're going to essentially appoint how many beneficiaries you have, such as how many people have a safety device? And let me open it up so I can show it to everybody.

14:21
Sure, we want to see it. Okay, is that a USB device? Is it Bluetooth or just USB.

14:30
So this one is a standard USB, but it is compatible with the USBC Adapter. So for like five to 12 bucks, depending on which brand you want to get. And it plugs into this where you can plug it into your phone. And we're gonna get into that a little bit later as far as why that's so cool, because we have a partner that's going to be looking to implement security key features for the application utilizing our technology. But yeah, so 

Once you fill out how many beneficiaries you have, such as how many children or people that are going to have a portion of this inheritance, then you fill out the merge authority section, which is just one person. And that's the person in charge of overseeing the whole distribution of the inheritance itself. The person who's going to get that inheritable data with all those beneficiaries, retrieve that wallet or log into the Exchange account and distribute the assets based upon what the owner of the state established with them in a off-chain contract, something that's not related to inheritance, right. And the merge authority can be a lawyer, someone who is in charge of handling transfers of the state, or if you don't want to deal with legal entities, you can make it to where your eldest beneficiary is the merge authority, and they hold that key that is required to plug in first because that's essentially what the merge authority is the master key that needs to be plugged in first, to initiate the merging process and merge authority. 

And the unique protocol that's patented and the military grade protocols that Juergen came up with, it's an AES 256 encryption. So essentially, whenever you input all of that inheritable data inside that dialog box, it gets encrypted utilizing that military-grade encryption, AES 256. And it takes that whole string of data and turns it into a special character string of data that's roughly 256 characters long, hence, the new five, six. And then that string of frat are of special characters that you can't really read because it's exclamation marks, hashtags, computer language, it gets fragmented in the multiple planet chairs, and the amount of planches that it gets fragmented into, depend on the number of beneficiaries emerge authority in the one verge authority, and backup plan shares that you initiate within the plan establishment during inherited. So let's give an example. Let's own


17:27
Yes, that example right now. So let's, let's use that example. Let's say you have five people that are going to be essentially receiving a portion of this inheritance. So it would be six plus the merge authority, right. So six different people would be having access to these safeties. And everybody would have their own plan shares, which is a fragmentation of that 256 encryption. And it would be pinko protected, because when you pay for the plan, when they inherit TV, a comment, which is a wild extension, it's a product of bars that essentially allows you to have a Metamask, VIP 180 In a sense for the Shotokan. So you put your shot tokens on that wallet, and then you connect and then you can pay for it and smart contract pops up. But after the person pays for it, they insert each safety device want to add time they press the button, you see that little finger? Yeah, yeah, you just press that and give it a little click. And then you type in a six digit PIN code, make sure that it's different for each beneficiary and merge authority to where somebody can just jack them all and be able to, you know, to trigger the DMS. So everybody gets their keys, and the owner of his day passes away, they meet with the merge authority, they plug in them one by one after the merge authority plugs there's and each one of them have to type in their PIN code. And then the planches are unlocked. And the system inherently recognizes there's one plant share missing. And that plan share is the validator share. This isn't this is an extra layer of security that we have created for the clients utilizing our service. And the validator share is locked by a deadman switch, otherwise known as a DNS. It's a fancy term in web three. But I want to make sure that everybody understands the full terminology. So a dead man's switch and what happens is when all those plan shares are there, but that validators miss and inherit, he's gonna say, hey, owner of the state, your beneficiaries are trying to retrieve your inheritable data. Are you still alive? Do you want them to unlock this validate a shift to where they can retrieve the inheritable data. And if you don't respond to the email, hence why we needed to implement a web to web three hybrid, the safe ID that's registered the email that's registered with the same ID, then that validator share we're going to unlock so you could do days, weeks months, so if it's a month, validator DMS on timeframe, then owner has stayed unanswered a month for login to the inherited platform because there's two different login bypass methods, per se, available right now, then the validator will unlock. And then when the beneficiaries meet back with the merge authority, now, they'll be able to combine their planches with the validator share, and Bob's arrow, well, as they say, a fancy saying, right. And, by unhearable, Data Merge authority is in charge of retrieving those wallets, logging into the centralized exchanges and transferring the assets in the manner described between the owner of the state emergent authority contract, which is separate from us, we basically just provide the tools that allow you to make the decentralized inheritance or Personal Backup, because people can use this for themselves to you don't have to use it for inheritance, right. And, yeah, they can use our tools, but we don't act as a custodial. Not yet. At least, we we have thought about doing certain certain features later whenever we implement the standard in Business Edition. But not right now. We're not offering anything of that nature.


21:31
Correct. And currently, as the Community Edition is limited to 500 characters, so you can essentially store a couple multi chain phenomics, and a couple of centralized exchange credentials within one plant. And then you'd have to make another plan, but it could store like more than 20 plans, so there's plenty enough room in there, you just have to pay 10,000 More shot, right. Not that big of a downfall, especially with the price being so low in the bear market right now. So, um, as far as storing actual documents, though, large data files, that's coming next. Okay. So, basically, inheriting Mugu is going to be one of our extensions that allow us to not necessarily bypass and remove the Save Key, because we're always going to enable this feature for people to have the cold storage version of their plant shares. Because this is protected against quantum computing whenever it evolves, in theory, because it's not connected. Whereas the mobile even though it's still going to be a decentralized method, and it's going to be a decentralized vaults, where only the owner of the safe ID account has access to those plant shares. Um, that's, that's like the next, the next step that we're doing for inherited is, well, it's kind of like to where it's more user friendly. And it allows people to have less barriers in case of they need a lot more safeties, because let's say you have a family of nine, um, you might not want to get that many different safety devices, right. So you might only want to have a safety device for the merge authority, and three or four of the beneficiaries, whereas the other beneficiaries utilize the hybrid solution by having their plan should share stored on their decentralized inherited vault. So as far as when we're going to happen here to move a launch, we've been working on it for over a year and a half now. And it's almost ready, we're just finalizing the API endpoints to where they can communicate properly with the inherited Vault, which is associated with the Hashi Corp version of inherent evil, because there's going to be two versions. And that's why I was bringing this up. Because I wanted to explain version one before I explain version two. Version two coming out later, is going to enable the storage of lat large data documents, such as videos or documents. So imagine, you want to give a video to your kid saying, Okay, I passed away, and I have some fun, still locked up in the centralized exchange staking pool. This is how you unlock it. This is how you recover the wallets. This is how you do this, this is how you do that, or just a heartfelt memory, maybe going to Disney World or a football game or something to make it less saddening. So the sky's the limit. And we've also thought about partnering with artificial intelligence, intelligence companies that are coming up with virtual animations of people to where you can have that video live. Right where you feel like they're still there, and be able to have conversations with that person after death, which may sound sad movie but we just want to offer services for everybody to be able to do what they want, right? We're going to let everybody decide what services they want. And I'm not promising that to come soon. I'm just saying those are things that we're wanting that's way out there.

24:55
Man that is way out there. The AI version of someone It just passed and you're actually talking to him. Wow, that just blows me away. You know, and you know, so many people we've been, I've been in this space over five years, and I know about wallets. I know how to send crypto this way, you know, so ease of use is, is the key for somebody that's not that, you know, inclined in the in the world of wallets and crypto and everything else. So, you know, that's like here in the next five years, you're gonna be able to walk into a bank in the United States and say, hey, I want $100 worth X RP or $300 worth of bitcoin and, and all this is going on behind the scenes, you don't know what's happening, you just know that you just purchased these tokens, and the banks charge you these fees. So yeah, I mean, right. A lot of we've already paid. Yeah. So you're, you're making it easy, as easy as possible for the public the world to integrate into this inherited ecosystem.

25:54
That's right. And we're, we're just really excited about some of the things that we have cooking in the background, too. And we're gonna get into that with some of the upcoming topics.

26:05
Hey, maybe I could pull some bread crumbs out of ya know, we've been talking about some things before we started recording that we cannot talk about which I'm stoked. I'm totally stuck. We can't talk about it. But is there anything else about inheriting we need to cover before we start working into the smart contracts and all that other good stuff, or?

26:26
Let me think that's everything. And that, that's just about everything. If anybody wants to dive deeper into inherit T, we've got plenty of information on the safe haven website, you can go to the inherited website as well. There's the FAQ, tutorial videos, etc. So plenty of resources out there. And if you have any questions directly, you can always reach out to me via telegram or Twitter. I telegram and Twitter are the same, it's at nebula underscore matrix. So

26:58
yeah, ticker scripts and below us in the description of this video, as well as we're putting it in the chat over here. So right down the legs, you know, save on follow safe haven as well as taller. And let's keep going. Let's talk about these smart contracts. It's talking about, you know, the XRP army is watching this video. So we want to know how you guys are becoming XRP ledger centric, or whatever you want to call it. I'll let you take it away. Take it away. Yeah.


28:15
I'm excited to do more work with them because we are going to be implementing our product features within the buildings of their Metaverse event nine. Yeah, and I want to talk about that once we get done talking about migrating the shots to the XR PL and how that can be a beneficial work around with not only them, but other Metaverse projects. So another project X Factor, everybody has been hearing about X Factor where we're working closely together with X Factor do an inheritance integration with them. I know I'm forgetting some other ones. We've got Lux lions as well. It's an NFC project on XR PL. I don't know if many people have heard about them yet. But but they're doing some big things they're building and treasure X, we've been talking to them in the background to the workouts and stuff and plenty of other projects. But what have we done with those projects already, we have done the inherited integration, which essentially allows people to establish inherit the plans and have their validator and backup shares on the D chain blockchain because our smart contracts are still on V chain for inherit t because we just recently went cross chain with say swap to where we are now on Matic finance, smart chain Aetherium and V chain, which is why we're bringing up this topic, we're going to be reaching out to Pontus Megabus and a couple of our other advisors to help us with obtaining a grant. So we're going to be applying for a grant to bring atomic swapping protocols to the XRP owl. And the vision that we have is a lot of people already know that there's bridges established or being established continuously between an avalanche and xr PL and adera and xr PL. So what our team sees is As with those being more EVM compatible, whereas XRP l isn't, we can make our atomic swapping contracts compatible with avalanche chain, or the adera. Right. And then once the tokens gained compatibility to go cross chain over to one of those two blockchains, and they have compatibility to go cross chain to the chain, finance, smart chain, Matic and Aetherium. So, that's the vision we have for obtaining this grant. And what it ultimately means is once we enable those features to have the Shotokan live on XR, Pl to where we can allow our people to do atomic swaps to lock up the 8180 tokens on a contract where they can unlock XRP L version tokens of the shot token from that pool to where it doesn't increase the total supply. That's the great thing about atomic swaps, it doesn't necessarily with the total supply, everything remains intact. So once shot is on the XR PL, then people will be able to use this shot XR PL to pay for the smart contracts that are going to be running in Harrity. So there'll be basically a checkbox in the platform where they could say do you want to utilize the XR PL Do you want to utilize V chain mat and Aetherium smart chain because eventually we're going to migrate in here to contracts all blockchains because we want to be agnostic with our platform because we want everybody to feel confident with their plan share validation, because quite frankly, I love all blockchains all of them are used for different things, because they all have certain capabilities with their smart contracts. And this is another point that I wanted to bring up, which is going to be a hurdle for us but we're ready to take it on with V chain. The reason why we wanted to go there first within heresy is because their NTP protocol like I was mentioning earlier, XR, pl, they don't really have smart contract protocols enabled for an MPP to our knowledge as V chain allows. So we're gonna have to find a workaround there. Essentially extra smart contracts that allow us to delegate the fees for our clients where they're not going to have to worry about it. It just takes more time, more research, more development. But we can get it done. We've been in this space for over five years. And once we enable these features, excuse me, it's going to be so great for all these other projects because then it allows them to access other decks all the other decks platforms or other staking platforms with ease, enter new communities get their face out there while still keeping their smart contracts for their Metaverse or whatever type of smart contracts they need for their product platform. What XR PL if they want to maintain, I don't want to use the term maximalist. But it's the only term that comes to my head. If they want to be maximalist for XRP fields where all of their gas all their transaction goes to the XR PL. They could do that. But still use a swap to get awareness and go to other places to draw people in. So like, that's what swamp excites us about the most. It doesn't only allow us to go to other blockchains. But it allows all the other projects that are building protocols on other blockchains. We're just wanting to get their face out there to utilize.

32:58
That's big, I mean, interoperability. Safe swap is so it's basically like a Dex it's like a decentralized Dex, right? Is that what safe swap is?

33:08
Yeah, it's a peer to peer exchange. Well, under decentralized, there's no inner party like there's, there's no third party. And it's not trusted like a bridge to where there's rap tokens or liquidity backing that token in a sense, because that's pretty much what rat tokens are. It's another form of that token, like a completely different token contract. Because atomic swapping, it's where you deploy the actual token contract to that tube and on another blockchain to where it's legit that actual token but just one other blockchain same supply, and it's all locked. The only way it can be unlocked is if you lock the available circulating supply on the current native chains and previous cross chains that are active.

33:54
Yeah, like I said, I learn every day even interviewing you I'm I'm learning things as being a crypto teacher every day, something comes into the space that hasn't been thought of before. I mean, in the last two years, since I've had my YouTube channel, I'm just blown away at how these ecosystems have evolved, how they're, they're working around the world to make the world a better place. And I'll tell you what, you guys are making it happen. And there's so much more in that we haven't even talked about today. What are some of the topics I have a topic list here I have a list of you know, questions and all that good stuff. Let's just wing it. Like I said, it's like we're sitting at the pub having a couple of cold beers I'm gonna let you take the show and run with it brother. I'm gonna let's try

34:38
it well. Well, I'm just some other things I want to talk about. If any XR PL projects are out there that are wondering how can we partner with safe haven? How can we work something out? Even if they're an influencer, like yourself, James. We offer integrations like referral links to where essentially you can integrate and harity with your own privately Whenever someone clicks on that link, make certain safe ID account and establishes a plan, you'll get around 498 Shy every time that plan is made. And that distribution will happen whenever we do our or utility reward distribution for nudes, because that's really the only time that we would be able to touch that pool of rewards. Right? But, but yeah, that's that's what we already have set up with universe verse x, we get to set up the space stack. Listen to me, I'm saying Space X, because I'm thinking about the connections. We actually have connections with them. Now. I'm not bullshitting you, man, de la, look in the magma, look in the magma. It's a real estate project, that we're essentially helping build a smart contract infrastructure to enable the building data to be converted into NFT data so that people can leverage their physical building in the digital Metaverse world. Wow. Yes, whether it's selling physical property, or leveraging the services that are utilized within two people who own partial pieces of this NFT. So in other words, imagine taken a hotel, for example. And for actualizing, that hotel or condominium into 100 NF T. And everybody had let's use XR PL because it's jealous current

36:33
among players, man, I'm all ears Come on, let's go

36:37
in everybody had to pay 30,000x RPL for a fraction of this building. And they know that this fraction is foreseen to produce x amount of passive income as it's rented out. Now, it's not all guaranteed, because within business, you have occupancy and vacancy, right. So it all depends on what fluctuations will be. But that's one of the main features that's going to be within magma allowing these real estate gurus to leverage their real estate empire in a digital world. And it's also for business buildings. It's not just for condominiums and hotels. So it's the same concept though, because it's cubicles that you'd be renting out to businesses in the sense you'd be renting out a virtual space and or physical space.

38:11
Yeah, expect or hey, I know the dark in the game that hey, we did it led to expect or we all love expected I'd say well, I just gave away five of the CO branded Leger nano s pluses from you know, dirt ship them to me not I gave back, you know, pay it forward to the community. They're building a phenomenal Metaverse ecosystem that's going to involve real estate, it's going to involve safe haven. Hello. All the above. So yeah, keep going. But yeah, that's

38:41
basically what I was talking about. People can get into heresy integration that utilizes the D chain protocols until we obtain the grant and are able to fully maximize the potential of making these inherently contract migrations and whatnot. And for those of you who are wondering what happens if you don't get the grant? Well, it's just going to prolong the amount of time until we can actually provide the access to x RPL. Blockchain. And I'm just being 100% upfront and honest, you know, because we have to be 100% on soil looking for, like, critical with where we put our development time and resources because it's limited with our developers and the extensions that we have to develop, right. So we don't have that many developers on one hand that can just hop off of a current task and do something else. So by getting those funds, it allows us to expand hire this new developers, and if we don't get the grant funds from XR, pl, then we would have to wait for a grant for another blockchain in the sense to try to do it on that one. But doesn't mean that we we wouldn't totally throw it out the window because we have other grant opportunities coming up from something that I was going to bring up next actually, Startup Grind, we got accepted into their startup program recently. And Startup Grind global. They're the largest startup Oregon. As a nation in the world, they've been around for over a decade, they've got 5 million plus businesses in their community. They're all community chapter members, their businesses that are mainly wet to looking to implement what three protocols and start going on crypto blockchain. So we're actually one of the first the first web three project accepted into the startup program. And we're going to be looking to leverage our products, we to let all of these businesses, 5 million plus integrate our defi products, because we have more than inherit T. And we're not going to get into all of them in this interview, because it would take way too long. But, um, yeah, we're going to be looking to allow them to integrate our services to where they can allow their 10,000 50,000 250,000 Daris a million clients that are already actively using their business platform to utilize our products. So that's a very exciting thing in itself. And by being accepted in that program, we now have access to a plethora of different venture capitalists and investors. And this is some some leakage. But we are officially going to the virtual summit in October 20. And I'm also going to try to make it over San Francisco for the physical in person event.


41:33
there's gonna be some big people there, man. Some some really big people. And, and you know, it's, it's a big, it's a big step for us, because we never did a seed sale. We never did a seed. So for anybody who's wondering, yes, we did the ICO and token sale portion of the token sold, but you're going to Nandy owns the intellectual property of safe tech, which is essentially the company that owns all the arm, the patents and the products, whereas safe haven is the company that owns the rights of the token, just throwing it in there. So they own 100% 5050. And we're looking to do a seat. So coming up after we have the full revamp of our product platforms, because that's been going on in the background for the last six months, seven months without people realizing it. We've been making everything more user friendly, preparing for inheriting mobile launch. And all that combined together is just going to allow us to just through fast track with with our development. And that's the main thing that startup growing excites me about just the opportunities of getting our face out there. And making those connections getting ready for whatever we do they do the seed sale.

42:42
Man, it's gonna be Matt, I mean, let me know. And I'll spread the wealth, man. Yeah, so how many clients or customers are currently using inherited? Hammond Hammond? Is there? There's got to be many, many out there. Right?

42:57
Well, that's an interesting and interesting factor two, you would think that there'd be 1000s or 10s of 1000s of people using this since it's been out for a year, right. But I'm 100% transparency, we only have about 10,000 shareholders and act whenever inherits the launch, we had about 3000 4000 shareholders. So we've come a long way over the last year as far as user adoption, just from word of mouth without mass marketing strategies, and without having been here to move alive. Because we still have that mass adoption barriers by people having to get the safety, right. We've had roughly about 450 500 plans made. So if you think from a user aspect, base of the existing community back whenever it launched, it's damn near 10%, which is great numbers in a business point of view, because most businesses, you only get about one to 3% of your targeted audience to utilize your products and most of the time,


nobody ever do this and all of a sudden is happening. And then they're like, Oh, crap, I'm gonna have to get in there. We're gonna miss out. So when you look at banks, whenever you look at companies, when you look at organizations getting into the metaverse, they're following where the public's gone. You know, just like NF T's and all this other stuff came about now the the metaverse, you're looking at meta you Facebook meta is how many billions of dollars they put into the metaverse. But this is where it's going. I mean, you're gonna put on your goggles, you're gonna shop from the house, you're gonna go to concerts, you're gonna go to the movies, and you're not having to leave the house, you know, and I'm old school. So being 55. I love human interaction, even me talking to you on Zoom. I like getting out in public going to a pub going to the movie theater. But eventually it's gonna get to the point where you'll never have to leave the house. And you guys are jumping into the metaverse. So let's go and you know, kind of get this kickstart. Let's talk about the metaverse, you guys are doing. So

46:34
Metaverse protection packages, it's a very interesting take on a marketing strategy that I've been developing with a Startup Grind in the background for the last six or seven months. So it's not going to launch anytime soon, we're still going to take our time to get a fully developed because there's a lot of moving parts. You're all about to see what I mean soon. But I'm hoping that we could get some launch sometime around January or April next year. But it could even be later than that. So don't hold me to that place. But what is the metaverse protection package? Okay, imagine having a package that's bigger than this one. And it has enough space to store two safety devices. And when you get that package, not only do you get the two safety devices, but you get to limited edition NFT. So let's give you an example. There's only going to be 1000 Metaverse protection packages available for the metaverse be a showcase that we're going to partner with for each one that we do. And there's going to be let's say, two different types of limited edition NF TS with with 1000 editions each, right. So very limited. The only way you can get these NF T's that are going to have actual utility in the metaverse to allow you to have passive earning income is by buying this package. So you'll get the two safety devices the two NF ts 10,000 Shot tokens the amount of tokens required to make a inherit D plan and $100 like 100 Fiat worth of the metaverse to a convenient showcase to where you have enough tokens to enter the metaverse and start upgrading your NF T's because the type of Metaverse is that we're going to be looking to go with here are ones that have upgradable, RPG NFT characters in the sentence, and those are going to be the NF T's that they'll be receiving. So they'll be able to upgrade their own NF T's that they just received to where they could farm or do things and I'm saying farming don't confuse me with the DAX. I'm talking about farming in the game to where they're working in the building or doing something and after X amount of hours. They get the metaverse token. So that's what Metaverse protection pact is about a limited package that gives you everything that you need to get started on your passive income journey in the showcase Metaverse while being able to establish a sci fi inheritance plan with military grade encryption protocols.

48:57
Keep us updated on that. I'm not my ears are perking over here. Okay, passive income. Metaverse, the metaverse, Project tokens, inherits the sake he's all about Yeah, keep me updated. Man. I want to know more when it happens. So yeah,

49:12
for sure. Yeah. And we're gonna look to do whitelisting for the projects that are being showcased. So in other words, let's say x Spectre, for example, if we have one going on with them, then everybody who has, let's say, 8888 expecting to love half that number, right? Everybody has that amount of respect. You could be whitelisted to have the first come first serve shot at their specific showcase members protection packages, or if somebody has an agent NFT one the limited NF T's already in their collections, then it gives them a shot at getting the next collection first. However they want to incorporate it but like, it's going to be really exciting to do this Metaverse protection package strategy with all of our different meta verses because we've got connections with more To the different blockchains in NFT projects. So it's going to give everybody the ability to have all these different opportunities, you know, and then dive into the gas infrastructures of each blockchain because that's what interests me the most was because honestly, I'm a Game Geek when it comes to NF T's mole that I just like seeing the interoperability and how you can easily pay for certain features in game, whether it's cheap or expensive. And I'm really curious to see how it's gonna go on. XR PL compared to Matic. I'm not like calling them out or anything like that trying to like, you know, say, Oh, who's gonna do better? But I want to see what comparison is going to be whenever we have live smart contracts go with the NF T's once they're able to be invented, how much is it going to cost for the guys to make a simple transaction for the NFT character to start a mission?

50:52
Man, you know, the NF T's are more than just pixelated or when you're looking at the tokenization of things in the metaverse. I mean, there's a project out there right now this working with Shiva in a tea that have tokenized actual racehorses in England. And you when you buy the NFT, you're buying a fraction of that race horse when the horse wins the race, either a real race or in the metaverse, you're winning is passive income. And that's that's what gets me excited all these projects, passive income, the projects, you guys giving back to the community, and that's what makes all the difference. Everybody's looking for something, I've always paid it forward, I will always continue to pay it forward, just like creating this video getting you guys out to the masses. And that's what it's all about. Okay, any upcoming partnerships that we can that we can talk about that you're not going to? Okay, okay, come on, let's do this, we

51:49
can talk about one. So playing a finance, many people probably not might not know about them from your community. They're they're really, really cool application that allows you to essentially do trading, defy staking a whole bunch of different stuff. And we're going to do a multi partnership with them. So we're going to open up the staking program with them to where there's going to be 2 million SHA two pins be EP 20 by Nance, smart chain version for people to unlock. So there'll be able to unlock some shots. So we'll get our token out there in front of the face of a new 15,000 30,000 Plus holders that are actively staking on their platform. So instantly going to double our wallet holders, hopefully. Right. That's good news. And then the other part of the partnership, is we're going to be implementing a security fee capability like that not obviously, they're going to be implementing that feature slowly. But we have a device that allows everybody to essentially only allow logins to their application. If they have the adapter on here. They plug it in such this during the six, six digit code. So

52:58
the elite, the elite Limited Edition. Yeah, yeah.

53:05
So like, that's one thing I didn't really touch on earlier with the safety. That's an extra feature. Um, I've got this bad boy right here attached to my gate IO Exchange account. So just to log in, people, somebody would have to plug this in, touch it, type in the six digit code, and then the other login activation fee

53:24
so so so that's two factor authentication as well. Right? Just like we use the Google Authenticator on the iPhone, that they're also provides to FA to the world.

53:35
Correct. It's another layer to FA you can add a couple of them with your with your iPhone, Google authentication, and you could also do it with withdrawals. So just like people would have to have this to log in to withdraw something from the exchange, you got to have this. Cool. So

53:54
extra protection man. Because I always talk about scams always talking about, you know, the biggest thing I've seen lately is people are sharing their damn seed phrases, their recovery phrases with the scam websites, and they're like, James, somebody stole my crypto, I'm like, No, you gave away the keys to your castle your seat for and, and I try to reiterate that all the time, the importance of keeping it to yourself, never share your information. And like I said, You guys are providing more a to FA protection to the world. And that's a big deal. That's massive.

54:30
But yeah, so they're gonna look to integrate that security key and integrate inheritance where people can establish plans by clicking the league and they'll have their own referral link. And we're actually going to look to have the 5% referral rewards re injected into the staking pool, where we can have a constant staking pool going Oh, cool.


58:05
Hey, now they're gonna ask me how do I went out? How do I receive the shot? What what wallet or how work? Can you store shot? If you wanted to send it to me?

58:15
That's a great question. Thank you. Um, so you could use the chain your mobile wallet that is essentially like a safe bow. Or trust wallet for the mobile device.

10:26
So anyone that's known me watch me heard whatever I said, Steve, you know this ongoing with the sons, I've thought that they had a chance since it was they had to play in games and like they burst battle and I said alright if the stars align and the church moment favorite they can do it then I was on record saying that hot take the students said not a hot take, but the sons will end up winning the finals. So now that the next step I I know it's going to be a series if the two games that they had I was looking at some stats, between the two very low season games, it was 253 to 251 total points, which shows that hopefully it can live up to that and be a good series. But I'll go with the SunSun six. Like I've always said there's only one person in the playoffs that was fully healthy that could shoot with anybody. And that was Booker. Now I want to see if he can live up to it because a lot of the people in the suns they're all freshmen, young CP threes, they're one that's going to basically give them a lot of the veteran experience. So Jae Crowder, will too. But I always was just talking to my friends the other day because we saw a Cameron Payne play in college and we knew he was going to be pretty nice, but we didn't know he would step up the way he did step up in the playoffs even when CP three was out, but it's going to have to be a lot of Chris Paul leading the way DEVIN BOOKER is going to have to give you almost 30 Every single time what whether or not Chris Middleton scoring, so you can't even worry about is he going to make sc not who knows. I honestly don't know. Drew's another one, that it'll be a good match of seeing Drew and Chris Paul, because are two of the more better point guards on defense as well in the league that we do have than just seeing like Booker and Middleton will be kind of good to see. I want to see what purchasing Crowder can do on Yiannis and who's going to stop eating that's Brook Lopez clearly is not going to be putting bodies on him. Well, I can see.


13:10
So I know Stephen, you can be a better man at times. Same with you, Tyler. Still, the eyes for game one are minus 250 for the sons. And then the spread is five and a half points. I can see it honestly being a close game, especially for the person because you know, they've only played twice in the regular season and it was a shortened season. So they're going to be feeling each other out. At least the first quarter who knows if Yan is is or is not going to be playing, they're clearly not going to play this brother to just replace the honors. So they're just going to have to figure out what to do. It'll be a big defensive game. That's what I do like about them. This isn't the old Phoenix suns that we used to see running gun all the time. They can do that. But when you have someone like a and he's very different than Stottlemyre was down there. And or when Shaq was there, it'll be a different ballgame that turned up playing there. But we did mention his name and I want to bring him in definitely for this conversation we're about to have because we're going to go into cryo chain a ticker symbol is K AI, but I would like to give a warm welcome to a good buddy of mine in the cryptocurrency space and he is the head of community engagement. For safe haven. We have Tyler Dusan.

Cool, cool. So that's something I really do appreciate about Tyler, just a little bit of background. So I typically will communicate with Tyler on Twitter. And he does do a lot of engagement and communication, whether it's on Telegram, or even on Twitter, and he's very good with the community, whenever anybody has anything, he'll get back to you. So don't ever feel like you can't reach out to him. And he also will have a lot of knowledge on it. And we'll love to break it down for you, we'll break it down here. But if there's anything ever on Twitter, if we don't cover anything, he can almost break down anything for you. And he's extremely supportive of working with other communities too. But I want to get into cryo chain in the sports aspects, so we can blend it in and then we can go fully into crypto. And just for people that don't know about K i, it's a blockchain infrastructure that is working to connect other blockchains. And the reason why Tyler and I wanted to bring this up today is the aspect of eSports. And then also just sporting in general that they have, because they're doing tips and different betting. And during COVID, they started to focus more on eSports. And a big one was League of Legends. So think of in different games, a lot of people probably know Halo or Call of Duty when you can get first blood. So there's a way for you to end up betting blue dank is going to get first blood or who do you think it's going to win? Or in some of the games, there might be killing dragons? Who do you think it's going to kill the most dragons in the game? So what are your thoughts on all of this? Tyler?

16:35
I think this is the future of pretty much everything. When it comes to gaming, sporting real estate, you pick an industry and crypto is going to be there 100%, especially when we start talking about international space travel and whatnot. But let's let's stick with the sports and gaming. So as far as sports, how I see it going to evolve the ecosystem as a whole. From a currency aspect, it's going to enable multiple different features of betting. I was just talking to Christian about this earlier. So y'all ever had a moment to where you're waiting in line for the guy in front of you to get that bat in and you might miss the window to get your opportunity. Or by the time you get up there, the money line changes. And now you don't want to take the bet? Well, we're crypto, you're gonna have a lot less of that, because you could do it within seconds. So you're not going to have to worry about the launch change, and you're not gonna have to worry about waiting in front of someone. And cardio chain. One of their main focal points is to put iPad devices in the seating arrangements of stadiums to where essentially, you can make play by play beds, you could tip the player after they score a goal and whatnot. Multiple different things. So it's really going to open up the movement of liquidity, as far as betting goes. But there's also a lot of other things that crypto is going to do. As far as accessibility to these games and events. I was actually discussing this with David Kerr, our strategic change advisor. So one thing that we both see these franchises doing is creating season ticket season tickets through the form of NF Ts. So yeah, so the the season tickets would be on your crypto wallet, they'd stay there. And then you'd only have to provide proof of ownership, maybe scan a barcode to show that it's on your wallet. And that allows you access to the booths up top this special booth some maybe backstage maybe discounts at the concession stand. All sorts of things because the way crypto works when you're talking about NF T's. It's a token ID that's created upon the minting process, and it's a limited amount. So it'll it'll tell you how many were created upon that minting. And all the token IDs never change. So essentially, they could write the smart contracts that enable people to purchase things for cheaper, while noticing those token IDs on your wallet to where it happens automatically to where there's no human interaction involved. It just reads it writes it done.

19:20
And what's crazy about that as Steven cuz I think whenever we go to Penn State Games, and you just think of what if it was take once so say Quan Barkley, if anyone doesn't know so what if it was safe once last game, and Steven I will get tickets for it. And you can almost have that as an NF T and just like when Jordans last game, just like when it was Kobe recipes his last game, those different tickets will still sell and D sell and things of that nature. So I just think about that aspect. And another big thing that we were talking about betting and tipping so I'd go to a lot of horse races too because that's a huge betting thing. And you can almost be right in your seat instead of having to go to the A stand up placing your bet it's up, you can do it right there. And then the odds are always going to change in horses. What if something happens to the horse right beforehand, and you want to switch your bet, and things of that nature. So it's a huge thing and their workload on sports, but I can only imagine if they were able to have their own app or synchronized into either FanDuel or action sports or even DraftKings. Any of those, just to help it move faster. I think it could be something big. So Steven, because Tyler and I were talking about it, what would you think of NFT aspect, if it was safe once last game or even? I don't know, it can be Alan Robinson, or anything of that nature.

20:42
I think I mean, just to go by what Tyler said, I think it's like, it's just going to change everything. Like, it's just going to be a ever evolving type of type of deal. And I think, once people fully understand, like, where that's going to take the sport, and like, how things are going to be presented. I mean, you're not going to like you're not never gonna, you're not ever not going to see it. And like, it's just, it's just like, Tyler, just like you said, I'm gonna keep saying this. It's just, it's, it's the future. Like, whether people like it or not, like, that's just like, it's just gonna be like that. I mean, that's just, that's just how that's just how it's gonna go. Which is, which, you know, you gotta keep up with the times, you got to keep up with everything, and things are just gonna keep changing. And especially with crypto, it's just gonna keep keep evolving. And like, we're, like we said, with with Mike, one of our one of our first interviews, like, it's very early, but things are just rapidly, rapidly approaching in terms of ideas. And those ideas get sucked in that it gets spit out in terms of like, here's what we're doing. So the, like, get on board with it. And so that's, I think it's pretty much how it's gonna go. And again, I'm just gonna keep referring to what Tyler said like it's the future. So I think I think it's great for the sports and like, make things a lot easier for people and more entertaining to say the least, which is like sports, entertaining enough. Like no matter what sport it is, it's Oh, it's always entertaining. I watched a lot of cornhole on my vacation. I watched a lot of the Johnsonville cornhole championships and that was some unbelievable sports moments. But just like it just, it just adds more value to everything. And that's as far as what people care about his value, like what brings in the most value, and what can they get their hands on, that's going to be the next big thing. And I think that's probably gonna be it, or at least one of them in sports.


23:15
Yeah, so I was I was truck drive. And then I was bored. Like any other driver, listening to YouTube videos on finance, how to advance my, my ways of life, right. And I just started getting into crypto, well, more more into crypto, like as far as the depth, I was always aware of it in the background before that, but I never truly started studying. And I never truly gotten vested. Because this is going way back when whenever I was a teenager I got one of those emails that was telling me about Bitcoin and I told my dad Hey, why don't we look into this and and one thing led to another that's back whenever it was peer to peer and you had to meet people in the coffee shop. Oh, Dad said now that ain't fine. So we didn't get into it whenever I was young. And then of course um yeah, so So going back to the truck driving, I started doing videos looking into it. And first one that first one that I bought was Bitcoin and the next one that I bought was was going bought a lot of days. I don't have any more as sold in memory and a couple of cents. But But um, yeah, that's that's what initially got me into crypto just learning more about it and listening to other people talk about it. And then fast forwarding, I became a community member and safe haven just to community member. I do really deep into the project, mainly because I actually lost my inheritance at at a young age and that's kind of what started the truck drive and to be honest. So that's why I was so passionate about safe haven in a sense, and I just started learning about the ecosystem helping the community. I just basically moved up the ladder ladder little by little in it Now here I am today just doing health community growth.

25:04
Yeah, it was crazy. So Steven, I think about this because I talked to some of my friends. When I first started engaging and talking to Tyler, I didn't even know he was the head of community management and engagement. I just honestly thought he was a great guy in cryptocurrency and also just knew a lot of information in safe haven. It's also a lot of projects. And then when I end up realizing his title, it just made so much sense because he was the right person for safe haven. And then if you just look along his Twitter, safe havens, so many people will give him applause, or just praise the work that he's doing, because he is doing such a great job. So that's something I always have to say. My next thing is how did the concept and idea of safe haven come about?

25:47
Yeah, so that's actually a pretty interesting one. That's that's all revolving around our founders Jurgen handy and Luigino in the past, so they all essentially met. And like a pub, like a, like a, like a beer Beer joint and discuss the idea there. So, Jurgen, he, he's, he worked for the British Parliament agency, he was on what was it? Security Engineer, like, had a security engineer there. He was engineering software and all that, like, he's crazy smart. And he's he's the brain behind it all. And, Andy, he's been in the industry as far as front end back end coding and whatnot for multiple different companies. So Luigino just was just connected with them. And yeah, so they met at the pub talked about the idea and one thing led to another, they started getting the patents process started developing the tech, got the licensing. Got got the two been registered underneath. Singapore isn't in Belgium, you can't have Grifters there. So that's, that's why it's like a two part kind of ecosystem. Safetech owns all the licensing and patents and whatnot, which is registered and in Belgium, while safe haven is registered over in Singapore, which is the cryptocurrency. But safe havens more than just inherit tea. It's it's a it's a massive defi products. It's more than just one. And we can go a little bit more into that. But would you want to say,

27:20
yeah, no, that was the big thing, I was actually going to give a shout out to you all, because a lot of people probably noticed there was an update and enhancement to the website. And that's something I wanted to give a lot of credit to, because I noticed a lot of people were talking about it. And I just wanted to give credit to you all for that, and then dive right into what is a payment.

27:40
Yeah, I appreciate it. Um, we've been working on the the inherent T update for a while that we'll release. First, we're about to release the new safe haven website. And that's going to be a total new look, it's going to be able to explain how all of our products work with ease, it's just gonna be a step by step flow, you can see all of our security audits, the protocols, Doc's videos on how to navigate through the platforms. So it's going to be much better than our previous website, and I think everyone's going to be pleased.


Yeah, so inherited. It's a web three platform that enables you to establish a decentralized inheritance or Personal Backup plan. And quite simply put, what does that mean? So a web three platform is a platform that does not monetize any of your data, it doesn't collect any of it. So none of your, like private credentials and information that you input while you're filling out the inheritance plan is recorded in the back end, we don't have any of that. All that data. It's encrypted, utilized, utilizing aes 256, military grade encryption. And then essentially what it does is it takes that long string of characters, turns it into an in readable format by the human eye. Then it fragments that into multiple shares. And then those plans shares are then stored on safe key hardware devices. I've actually got one with me. Let me grab it really quick.


29:49
But this is this is the box that it comes in right now. If you could see it. Come on. Yeah. And then when you open it up, you get this little a, it's like a USB drive, right? And you essentially just, you plug it in, and then you squeeze it to activate it. And then it's gonna ask you to input the food that your parent, the deceased gave you upon retrieving the safeguard, because the way that it works is all of that information, encrypted, fragmented, some of it is some of the plan shares are stored on here for your heirs. And then they have to have a PIN code to essentially offload those shares and merge them with their siblings or other beneficiaries in the merge authority. So the only way that this planet shares can come off. So that's another additional layer of security that we've developed. But yeah, it's, it's rather unique. So whenever you pass away, you get with all of your siblings and the other beneficiaries, you meet with the merge authority, which can be anyone, it could be the oldest heir, or it could be what we recommend, which is a lawyer. And they don't even have to receive a portion of the inheritance. But they're the merge authority with the plan shares. So when I'm saying and when all plan shares get combined, here's where the magic happens. You can't just look at the inheritance plan. No, you have to wait for the validators share to be released from the blockchain. Well, how does the final share get released from the blockchain? Well, that's the deadman switch. When you're filling out your inheritance plan on inherit team, you literally define the amount of time that you have to respond to the message, which could be an email that sent to you, or you logging into the inherited platform with your safe ID account. Now we're going to add column and text messaging and stuff like that as we advance and we can add those features. But for right now, it's just email and logging into the platform. But if you basically respond to that message or login within the amount of time required, the validator share does not get released, because that tells the system Hey, I'm still alive. Don't let my beneficiaries get that stuff. That's good. But if you're not alive, then that plan that validators share gets released from the blockchain. All planned shares are there. And then the inheritable data, the inheritable data dialog box is completely revealed, you see everything that was typed from the beginning. And that's another really important thing that I want to note. So when you hear a decentralized inheritance plan, we don't control who gets what portion of what, all we do is provide a service that enables you to encrypt data to where no third parties can get that data. And then your heirs get that data. So they recover the wallets. And then they're going to be directed by the merge authority, which is why we recommend a lawyer to distribute those assets. So you get with the lawyer and you say, I want 25% here, 10% here, 25% here, yada, yada, yada. But if you're in a certain religious areas, such as the Muslim religion, they believe in having a certain amount of inheritance going to each area, they can't even decide the Quran tells them. So we're getting off subject a little bit. But that's,

33:33
that's deep. That's. So the next one is, and I appreciate that, because it's a huge thing. And I'll start relating it into the next one, because the next question is a community question. So chuffed Krypto crip? On Twitter, he ended up giving this question, I'll bring it into a real life example. So the question is, how easy is it for loved ones to access info following a loved one's passing? So my example would be so my Auntie has passed away in March. And so my uncle is still living. And so a lot of people are going to start to think So hypothetically, he wants to start getting invested into cryptocurrency, how could he end up using this? And what will happen to let's say his grandchildren? Because he has four if you were to pass away, and he had inherited?

34:15
Yeah, great question. So first thing that I would recommend, get all centralized and decentralized exchange credentials, and include those as well. Because a lot of people don't realize when it's our time to go, it's time to go. We don't think about stuff like that. So if you have tokens, hard luck, not soft luck, hard luck, because that's usually what it is on an exchange in a pool to where you can't take them out and you pass away. Your heirs or The Heirs, the deceased need to have access to that platform, so that they could take those tokens out and move them around to the wallets needed after the hard lock is up. Right. So that's the first thing I would do. I would make sure that they understand to put all credentials, not just price Haven't wallets? Because of what I just said. But um, yeah, so input that data, all data that's needed to recover access to those assets, then you get with your errors and you explain to them. Look, it's as easy as you see this little video safety device. You hold on to this. And then you type in the PIN code, whenever it's time to merge the plan shares. You wait for the DMS to go on answered, then the message is revealed as far as which you need to recover the assets, the lawyer tells you how to go about it. And then that's it.

35:37
That's really good. That's yeah, that's really good. The second part is going into NFT. So this was also brought up on Twitter, and then I'll give an example. So we were talking about NF T's earlier, but explain how one can use inherit T for NF t. So for example, I was communicating with the safe haven community because I someone just mentioned an NF T for me. So how could I use inherent T with the NFT?

36:04
Yeah, so your NF T is stored on a private wallet, all you need to do is input the Manam ik phrases, or the keystore of that private wallet to the inheritable data dialog box. And then that's all that the heirs would need to recover that wallet because the NFT is stored on there. So if they have the data needed to recover the wallet, then they can recover it and then move the NFT to whichever other wallet they want. Because one thing that I'd like to point out, you shouldn't expect your heirs to keep that wallet that you give to them, you should expect it that you should expect them to go into the wallet with the merge authority and distribute the assets that belong to them to their private wallets that their brothers and sisters or other beneficiaries do not have the credentials to. If you don't do it like that, and you keep everything on the wallet that everyone has the information to, then that's kind of that's kind of silly, right? So when you're making the plan, I'd make sure to have a segment in there that explains to your beneficiaries, hey, if this merge authority isn't doing his job, right, and telling you to distribute them on your private wallet, because maybe the merge authority wants you to keep it all in that wallet to where they can go back and steal it later. Who knows. Right? You got to think like that. So that till the beneficiaries make sure you make your own private wallet so that you're ready to send those assets as soon as you have access to. And yeah,


41:30
I probably butchered it. But when he was there with with was it. I think, Josie from Tim Draper's Foundation, and they were doing a fireside chat. And the main thing that side was mentioning was how they're wanting to get blockchain developers over at their new convention center that they're building in Dubai, that's totally revolved around getting startup projects to start in Dubai, get funding all that stuff. And provide a lot more opportunities for the people of Dubai as a whole as well as teaching the children. So really cool idea of of what they want to do in Dubai with Blockchain technology, and what got me thinking about what safe haven could do, other than inherited, providing decentralized inheritance for all the digital assets and, and software management, all that stuff, because it's not just crypto related, it could be traditional as well. Was fun request fund request is another product of ours. It's an open source platform that enables you to essentially outsource coding or development work needed on smart contracts. So in crypto, in order for you to move the currency from one location to another, or to use the currency to pay for something that will be AirDrop to your wallet. Based upon a time lapse contract. That's all smart, smart contracts, you have to create the coding for that there's multiple different languages that are used depending on which blockchain you're writing on. So you're talking about a lot of stuff, right? Well, fund requests is going to be the platform where you can outsource all that it's going to be like the fiber of the blockchain in a sense to where you can go on there and say, I'm offering X amount of tokens for you to complete this one simple contract this one simple task. So inexperienced developer, they're gonna go on that platform, and they're gonna see that bid, in a sense, and they're gonna say, Okay, I want to take that on. So they take it on, they complete that work to where now you just fast track development. And you don't have to wait months to look for a full stack developer, and then wait months for them to implement the code where some random guy across the country or across the world just did it in a matter of days for whatever fee you put there, which would have been much cheaper than actually building a team in a sense, right. And it's going to be the very first platform on by Nance smart chain of its kind. So that's, yeah, it's it's gonna be huge.

44:09
So what would you say were some of the benefits for you all going to the conference out there. Um,

44:19
biggest benefit was getting our name out there. That's, that's always the biggest benefit, getting your name out there and making a presence in front of everybody. It's always number one. Number two, is it comes with getting your name out there. But making the connections we met a lot of other people who are also presenting their projects that we are looking to do work in a sense as far as providing integrations of inherent T or any one of our other products and an integration simply meaning giving them the API codes to where they can connect with our platform with their platform to where users can press buttons and never leave their platform while getting our services kind of like a white label deal in the sense almost But um, yeah, so that. And then also private in Angel investors, there were many people who attended the private and angel investors and they settled on one on one meetings with us, we had so many different meetings, like sitting at the table for hours of the day, having numerous groups of people coming up saying, Okay, we want to invest this much for for this and return, and just seeing all the deals, right. And I'm all down. And now we're in the process of basically facilitating with them deciding which provisional partnerships would be best not only for the foundation, but as to prefer the community as a whole to provide steady growth. And, yeah, that's, that's about where we're at now. We're basically just in the facilitation and feedback stage.

45:49
Yeah, I got it. Yeah, I got a quick question. Did you guys have a goal going over there? I know, like you said, the goal is always to get your name out there and to make those connections and to build off those connections. And obviously, you go to other reasons than that. But did you have a like any one or two particular strong goals that you went over there saying, Hey, we're gonna, you want to accomplish this, this, this and this or make a connection with this person or anything along those lines?

46:17
Yeah, um, the primary goal was essentially making connections with a couple of the High Excellency people there to establish a presence for inherited our flagship product. And that's where we spend all of our time and dedication on inheritance is our bread and butter. That's, that's our baby of safe haven. Everything else, believe it or not, was just a side project that was built for fun while we were waiting on this seriously, while we're waiting on patterns and stuff like that to get a range or, or like the next step for inherent t, because it comes a lot of time, times to where when you're developing something, you do the work, but then now you have to wait for it to get audited. Now you have to wait for someone to review this. So what are we going to do in the meantime? Well, what we did was we built other products that the world needed.

47:08
Yeah, so yeah, what and that's a big thing. So Steven, we were talking in the beginning, about how in Dubai, they have money, this meeting with all these different companies, there was money in there, that is a big thing for sure. That I know. The next one is the community question again. And it's kind of funny that name because the question goes along with the name. So it was from providing clarity on Twitter. And they said, Can you take time to break down and explain, say slop and analogy, maybe without technical words, so provide clarity?


48:02
you get rid? Yeah, I gotta stretch myself for this one. Let's do this. Okay, so say swab is going to enable us to port, any product of ours, to multiple Aetherium virtual machine chains. So that means we're not going to be limited to V chain, we're not going to be limited to Aetherium binance, smart chain Matic let's say quantum couple of them when dry. There's multiple EVM chains that we could port our products to, as soon as we get done writing the token contracts for us to do the atomic swap of the shot to come to that one. Now. Atomic swap. That's important. It's not no standard swap, where you're just creating another token, a whole new supply. And then now you're diluting the supply. No, none of that. God no. An atomic swap is to where essentially, you can only swap one token for another if the previous one is locked for X amount of time. So essentially, we'll say swap is going to enable is let's say you need to take 10,000 Shot tokens and put them on the Ethereum blockchain, right? Well, there's going to be a pool to where you send the 10,000 shot tokens to this pool. It gets locked, it's all in a smart contract. But then the smart contract recognizes that you sent that much to that pool. So inadvertently what happens is 10,000 tokens from the Shah ERC 20 Pool instead of VIP 180 Pool different token right. Will get released input one, you're my Safe Wallet, which is our open source. Wallet, pretty much like the white labeled wallet like you know how there's there's wallets from from arcane Vin Lee, and you could add in token contracts like like trust wallet, for example, you can add different contracts and keep Yeah. So as we expand to other chains and whatnot, we're going to add support through my safe wallet so that those secondary utility assets can be added, as well. Or like for the client who's wanting to use our products on those other chains, that's good. But that's what's gonna happen with se swab, it's going to allow us to port all of our products to pretty much any EVM chain. Our primary focus, though, are the first four, the V chain, binding, smart chain, Aetherium, ematic, those are our primary focus. But yeah, as we advanced will add more, but also is going to allow our users to decide where they want to store their validator and backup shares for inherit t as well, sir to support a change and whatnot. But it's it's going to open up some other things I can't talk about right now though, team would go me

51:07
know, yeah, I thank you for the breakdown, because that that will help a lot of people to understand and and provide clarity, so that people will be able to act and go about this in the right direction. The next big thing because a lot of people will bring up say swap is staking. And you all just ended up finishing up the June staking and you have different tiers to it. So explain with staking is for safe haven, and what it offers to investors as well as the tears.


55:50
Yeah, of course, um, feel free to reach out directly to me at my email, which is tailored t y l e, r at safe tech.io. That's s a f e. T c h.io. Or Twitter's a great way to get a hold of me it's my handles, nebula matrix with the underscore and between nebula and matrix and Telegram, same exact thing. Just capitalize nebula underscore capital and lowercase matrix. And the only reason why I do that is because someone actually try creating a fake nebula account on telegram. So adding capitalize everything to where people could tell what the real Nebula was, because what they, they were sneaky men, they capitalize the L, they capital, they capitalize the lowercase L and Nebula and look the exact same. So I was like, Okay, I see what you're doing here.

Substrate Social Recovery Pallet Code Walkthrough with Joe Petrowski and Shawn Tabrizi

Yeah. So this social recovery palette is a way for you, for people who use a straight blockchain to be able to recover access to their account, if they lose access to power, so normally, this would probably be like losing your private key or losing your seed. But you know, I guess, you know, some, she doesn't really assume necessarily that you have to use public key cryptography to access accounts probably can do other methods. And no matter kind of how you set up your system to access your account, recovery actually has the ability to give you back access, if you were to lose that access.

00:47
Yeah. And so we talked a little bit about this as an intro, in our last video, we'll put the link in the description. But all of the signature verification happens outside of the runtime, and like the, the palettes just get this origin. And so we're going to use that concept here. So we don't really have time to go like a deep dive into it. But if you're confused, go back and watch the our first video for sure. So yeah, let's get into a recovery. Where this, you actually lose your private key, and you can still recover your account and send funds from it.

01:20
Yeah, so I think I'll use some words, some of the key words here. So we call this an m of n social recovery tool. And what this basically means is that we are able to recovery advice through social means, but through other people basically saying, This person has lost their account, we trust that this person was the person who lost the account, and we can give access to a new person, or a new account to have access to the old account. Ideally, this person in the whole situation is just you. But you have one account, and you lost it. And now you get another account. And people can help basically say we're going to tie your new account to your old account.

01:56
Yeah. And so what do you have to do first, so to get started, so like in order to you can't just recover your account, if you lose your private key, you have to do some stuff ahead of time. So what does that what you have to do get ready?

02:06
Yeah, so the whole process is actually quite simple to walk down. And we can actually do that by walking through the different functions in our declare module. So the first thing you need to do is, with your original account, the one that you want to be to want to recover, you need to while you still have access to it, of course, create a recovery process. And creating a recovery process is pretty simple. It's basically just setting up a configuration. In the Create recovery configuration, you'll see there's just three options here. There's a list of friends. So this is a vector of accounts that you trust to be as the gatekeepers of your account, you have a threshold, which is some subset of the number of friends you pick, which you say must say, like, yes, or approve your recovery process for you to actually get access to it. So let's you pick like five friends, and you say you need three of them to say yes. And then a delay period, this is actually very critical piece that maybe we'll talk about a little later. But the delay period, basically says how long from the beginning of a new recovery process? Do we have to wait until the account can actually be recovered? And this is an important tool to prevent malicious users from getting access to your account through, you know, maliciously, like, you know, targeting your friends and having them tricking them into saying yes, and stuff.

03:16
Yeah. So this is mostly to prevent attacks here. So I think we'll get into that at the end. Yeah. So let's go through what this recovery structure looks like. And then how we actually start recovering.

03:27
Yeah, so one important piece about runtime developments and any kind of these processes is that we need to take deposits when users put data on the blockchain. So actually, even even better than putting a deposit would actually be putting some wrecked on some storage. So if you know there's a, there's a kind of a classic problem that's happening in the Aetherium, smart contract world where basically, there's so much storage being used on Aetherium, you only pay one fee upfront when you make the transaction. And once you pay that fee, it's just there forever. So the longer your story is on the blockchain, the less it costs like per day for you to put it on there. Right? Right. And this is kind of a not something that you can, you know, have forever because the smart contract world, anyone can create smart contract, that's my contract can support any type of storage item. And it just doesn't doesn't scale in the long term. substrate in this in their, in their contracts. The pallet actually solves this problem with storage rent. At the runtime level, we don't actually quite have storage rent yet. I think it's something that we might be thinking about in the future. But for now, what we do assume is that if a user is ever talking to one of our pallets, and is going to store some information, for example, a configuration for recovery, we want to make sure to store deposit for them. So in addition to having these inputs, and we do some basic checks to say, okay, all the inputs sane, what we also do is we take a we take a deposit from your account, we basically reserve a deposit which says we're going to store some funds, you do not have access to these funds, as long as you have a configuration. If you remove your configuration we get back to you. But as long as you want your account to be recoverable. We're going to hold some funds from you to basically say okay, this Just going to this is going to take into account whatever storage you're holding

05:04
on the blockchain, right? Yeah. And this deposit varies based on what

05:07
it varies based on number of friends you pick, I'm also in general, it can be completely configured. So you see here, there's two configuration options here. Basically, one is like the base deposit fee. And the other one is the num. deposit fee based on number of friends you select. So you as a runtime person wants to use this palette runtime engineering, so use this palette, you can actually configure exactly what these deposits should be for your blockchain. But know that in general, that we expect the the more friends you store, the longer this deck that we store is of your of the friends you have. And therefore we want to charge a little bit more per user, right?

05:41
And then so you can see here, this recovery config, that's going to create this struct, and it's just this, it's this deposit, and then the other inputs, so your delay, your friends and the threshold.

05:51
I think one thing that's also important, so you know, of course, you know, each user may have a different amount deposited, based off of, you know, how many friends they have, right? We could retro actively calculate that. But I think in general, it's kind of a best practice to store this deposit information along with recovery configuration. One, this storage item doesn't really cost anything. But if for whatever reason, you know, if you could think of I can think of a million random scenarios where in some future, we update the configuration with a deposit mount is different. And then there were some users who did before and then we reserve some money, and then later we change it, you know, not keeping track of how much we reserved from a user is kind of an important detail to have that later, when we want to unreserve the deposit, we can raise unreserved the correct amount, no matter how could have overtime changes. So it may seem kind of redundant to store this item. But I think it's kind of best practice to do so.

06:42
Yeah, sure. Yeah. So you create the storage item. And then let's say you lose your accounts, how do you go about recovering? Yeah,

06:49
so the next step of the process to lose your account, I would recommend not following that step. But if for whatever reason you lost your account, no need to fear you have a recovery process set up, you need to actually start it. So the very next thing you need to do is basically initiate a recovery. And so I want to be transparent here and say that this process this entire module, no one can actually recover your private key, it's not possible to go have a process where we're going to give you back your private key kind of in this nondescript way, what we do this give you back access to the account. And we do that by basically granting another account, access to call making calls on behalf of another account. So we need to do to initiate recovery processes, one, create a new account, and to basically buy some tokens or funds so that the user can pay for the transactions that are that follow and also pay for the recovery deposit. So it's similar to the deposit needed to store the data, we also take a deposit for a user wants to start a recovery process, right? Yeah, so let's take a look at this real quick. So basically, this, this can be called by any user, that's simply permissionless. So anyone, whether it be you or someone malicious, could initiate a recovery process on your account. Again, we take care of that with another with the delay factor. But anyone can initiate recovery process, we basically verify that the account that you want to recover is recoverable. And we take the deposit of needed to start the recovery process. And then we basically start putting the storage Hey, there is some kind of active recovery process happening. Yeah, you can see here that we store basically that when it was when the process was started, again, how much money we deposited from the user we taken from the user, and the list of friends that are going to that have approved the recovery process. And right now it starts empty. Yeah,

08:32
because you're just initiating so nobody's done anything. Exactly. And so now the storage item goes in this active recoveries,

08:38
yeah, now users can actually go and help you recover your account. Yeah. So now you need to call your friends. Exactly. So off chain, or maybe on chain, if you have some, you know, fancy pallets there. But probably off chain, you go call them say, Hey, I messed up, I lost my account. I made you as one of my friends, can you please call this palette with this function with these details and help me recover my account? Yeah. And so your friends would call this vouch recovery function. And this has three input or x two inputs. One is the account, which is lost. And the other one is the account that you believe is correct. And so you know, when you're collecting user, you should tell them, hey, I want to recover my old account, which is this one, and I am this account, right, right, of course. And then again, there could be multiple recovery processes in parallel. Again, imagine a malicious user is attacking you, you want to make sure that the person who's approving the correct recovery process, so these details are important. Basically, what we do here is we just check, hey, you know, is there an active recovery for this? For this account? Are they part of the friends list? And if they are, have they already said yes or no to the recovery process? You know, have they already vouched for that recovery? If they have already rouched obviously not going to put two doctors in there that could break the system, but if they have a bit they haven't we insert in this new recovery. You can see one of the things we do here is we actually use a vector. And we also do things with a binary search. So basically, we want to very quickly find if a user is part of this vector. And if we do an you know, an unsorted list, it would have you know, complexity of what, like, n log n?

10:16
I don't remember. Yeah.

10:19
I think there's like no end. Oh, no, it was sorry, you just to search, the entire thing would be just end right? You don't you ideally have to look at every single item in the list to be able to find if that account was there. Yeah.

10:28
So the expected value will be half the list. Yeah.

10:31
So if you, if you're going and you do a sorted list, the search time goes to log in, right? Because you can basically do a binary search and find the element more quickly, right. And so you know, it's almost zero cost in this in this situation to basically since we started with an empty list that we just insert every item sorted. And then we can when we look up, when we do searches, we can search it sorted. So this is one of those things that if you're using vectors, if it's possible, always use a sorted list. Yeah. Makes sense. Okay. So yeah, so you have all users they vouch you need to have again, you know, at least threshold number of them say yes,

11:08
yeah. So now you're kind of like waiting. Because it's not just, this voucher isn't just going to be called once, like, you need to find your threshold number of friends. For example, three people needs a call vouch exam, and then like, so once, three people have called vouch then what happens? Yeah, so

11:22
maybe like, in one world, you're able to just say, Hey, I got my account recovered. But this is not necessarily secure. Again, I think one of the things we know in the security world is that the number one fault of sick of like people maliciously getting access to your account is actually not through software problems, but through a social problems that, you know, someone calls their friend saying, hey, you know, this, you know, Shawn died. And you know, the parents are trying, I'm a lawyer for the parents and trying to recover the account, please, you know, prove this recovery process, blah, blah, and you being a very nice and willing friend, and very sad that your friend passed away are going to just say yes, and this would allow a malicious user to, to basically abuse the system. So what we include is this delay period. And this delay period is this mechanism, basically, where even after you've gotten all of your approvals, the MO, then approvals, you still need to wait at least some number of blocks that you define before the account can actually be recovered.

12:15
Right. So in that case, like, say, you set a to, I don't know how many however many blocks is equal to one month, yeah, one month, exactly, then you just need to check your account every month and check if a recovery process has been initiated.

12:28
Exactly. So if you have access to your account, all you need to do is once a month check is someone else trying to recover my account, if they are, what you can do, actually, it will skip this claims, let's just get the malicious path. If there is one malicious trying to recover your account, and you detected it, you just call close recovery. And we're close recovery assumes is hey, this has been called by the account that is trying to be recovered. Obviously, if you can call with that account, you have access to it, so it's not actually lost. And what you do is you just take the reserve the reserve funds from that user. So you see here we call repatriate reserve, which basically takes from one person's reserved and puts it into my free balance. So if Joe is malicious, and trying to attack my account and trying to start recovery process, even if he gets all my friends to say, yes, Joe has to wait one month, and I can just check once a month say, Oh, wow, Joe is trying to steal my account, take his funds from me. And well, I just got paid for this guy trying to attack my account. Yeah, it's like a honeypot. Right? Yeah. And so this is that mechanism for being able to basically keep your account safe. And so the longer the delay period, you pick, obviously, the longer you have to wait in a successful recovery attempt. But also, the less often you need to check your account, right, it's up to you to kind of determine what is the right number?

13:40
Yeah. So if we say this was an honest attempt, and as you went through this recovery process, and then you wait, you wait through the end of this period, then what do you do to actually recover the accounts? Yeah. So

13:49
then what you do is go back up one level and call this claim recovery function. And claim recovery function is very simple as well. It basically checks are all the parameters met? Right? So we get your recovery configuration, we get the active recovery process? And we say, okay, are the number of friends in the active recovery process that had been approved? Meet your threshold? And that's what this one here is this threshold check. And also is the current block time, you know, greater than what we'd expect for the thresholds, we check the the initial day of the active recovery being created, plus the delay period. And that's when we start checking is the block number past that limit, right? And if all of this happens, we do something really innocuous, all we do is insert one storage item we insert into recovered the account that is trying to be recovered, and who you are the person who is allowed to recover that account.

14:43
Yeah. So now you have you can actually assign messages on behalf of that. Yeah.

14:47
And so what we can do is we can jump up but this will actually say here real quick is that every account can only have basically one user who can access it at any time. And so if you have this storage item set, you can go all the way back to the top and there's this one option called as recovered and as recovered, basically checks the storage item is there and allows one user to make a call on behalf of another user. Again, we talked about this in the last video, it has to do a lot of cool stuff with origin. But basically, you know, you can make a call on behalf of your loss account using another account, we haven't given you back a private key, we've given you all the access your other account has.

15:21
Yeah, so if you lose your account A and then you create a new account B, and you recover a with b, you can actually send a transaction from B, using this as recovered and say, and make the other pallets and you're on time think that this actually came from a

15:36
exactly and this is much more powerful than other recovery mechanisms are kind of existed in the smart contract world or in other places. Because in substrate, we can actually control what your palate who your palate thinks you are in every other kind of system, you'd have to build in logic for kind of every single interface you're interacting with would have to have some logic on how recovery would work. But here, you can just have the I am this person. And this allows you to put on that mask or allows us to trick the other pilots that I am that person. And that's kind of the magic here that one pallet a mix all of your system recoverable,

16:09
right? And yeah, if you want to learn more about this origin stuff, you should definitely go check out this other video, because it's a really powerful feature of substrates. Yeah,

16:17
I think one or two more things we want to touch on. Before we end this thing. One thing I want to mention real quick is set recovered. So we also added a special functionality in the chain to allow governance to also automatically skip through the whole process. So if for whatever reason, you know, your your friends, your recovery accountant didn't get recovered, and you didn't, you didn't put a recovery configuration on your account, or your friends aren't supporting you or whatever. If you can convince whatever body has access to the root origin to give you access back to your account, we allow that to happen. I assumed this process would be much more difficult than any other recovery process here. So like, you should assume that this root access should be much harder to get access to then basically going through a correct malicious process. Yeah. But it's something that's there that even if you haven't in a recovery configuration, if you know that creator of the blockchain, or you know the right governance, people, you can make it you can make it happen. Yeah,

17:15
yeah. So if like, if your cruise ship things, and all of your friends are on it, yeah, then maybe you can convince governance that, yeah, but you actually need people to vote to let you do this.

17:26
Yeah, there's no promises on that this function will ever actually work for your situation. But again, it's whoever has access to root, we assume this is the highest privilege level that highest privilege, Jewel should be able to give you access to your account. Yeah. And then the last thing in terms of the story, after you close the recovery process, this was this was, you know, getting back your reserve deposit, you can actually remove the recovery altogether. And so this is kind of a process where let's say you're finished, you're finished cleaning up your old account, you can actually remove the recovery process, you get back your final reserved funds for actually having a recovery process. And this allows you to transfer the last piece of, of balance out of your old account into your new account. And then we have some automatic magic at the bottom, we have this trait called Henrique account only become gets triggered whenever an account has absolutely zero funds. That means no free balance, no reserve balance. And when that happens, basically, we assume that account is totally dead, what we do is automatically clean up the recovered process here. So as long as your old account has some funds in it, and you have gone through the successful recovery process, you will always have access to your account. But as soon as you get rid of everything from it, it cleans it up. And now this is an account back in the wild that you know, just has nothing, no information, nothing on that no state at all. It's all clean. Exactly. And so in general, as a running developer, you can you can create this, you can add this trigger to your palette to basic cleanup, or do some cleanup on your blockchain or your palette so that it removes items about users who don't matter anymore. And so after this is triggered, no user will have any information about their palette that is not in the that's not being active or in process of being recovered or anything like that.

Substrate Recovery Pallet - Shawn Tabrizi

what multi signatures multi signatures are, it's a type of verification, which requires multiple keys to authenticate or authorize access to the underlying resource.

. So when we're working in the runtime, it's really easy to be able to say, like, Hey, I see multiple transactions from these different users all saying, like, you know, approve, or not approve. And we can basically create a multi signature in the logic by basically saying, you know, have the set of users approved or not approved something and do some action based off of that. So we also have some aggregation methods. And again, the aggregation can actually be done on chain and off chain. So you might imagine, instead of sending one payload with one signature, you can send one payload with many signatures in it. 

the recovery palette is that m of n social recovery tool. It allows users to recover their accounts, if the private key is lost, or any type of authentication authentication mechanism is lost. So one thing that's important to realize is that on substrate, it's built really generally, and I believe it doesn't even assume necessarily that the account system that we use has to be like a public private key pair like there could be other authentication mechanisms. 

the first thing you need to do is set up a record recovery configuration. So ideally, you have access to your account that you want to make it recoverable. And you have to basically go through and configure it so that it can be recovered in the future. To do that, first you need to select a set of friends that you trust. This is configurable. And basically, it's a set of other users in substrate, who you trust to say that they can go through and vouch for you later. And say that, you know, this person has left the account. 

And this is the real person. And this is who we should give the account access to. This is where the end comes from. Then you also choose a threshold M. So it can be as much as n is, but it can be less to where basically, these are number of friends of the lists that need to approve of a recovery process for you to actually build to recover your account. Right, this is the m of n. Finally, we pick a minimum delay period. 

So this is kind of a something I'll touch on a little bit more later. But basically, from the beginning of a new recovery process, like someone trying to recover your account, there is some delay period, where we say even if you collected all of the approval messages, you still have to wait this long to actually get access to your account. And this is the mechanism we'll actually be using to help prevent against some of the malicious attacks. But these are all, you know, three items, which you can configure completely on your own, to set up a recovery configuration for your account. 

The last thing you need is a configuration deposit. So as a runtime developer, one of the things that's important is that if you're introducing some new storage item to the runtime, it's important that, in general, you keep a deposit from the user who's storing some information. This has a few things, one incentivizes the user to clean up their information. So if you go through, if you write the right runtime logic, they add some data to your blockchain, they take some deposit, they remove the data, they get deposit back. So they're incentivized naturally clean up the blockchain. So this is kind of where you should be think about as a runtime developer, always making sure that if you're storing data, you have a deposit for that. But to set up a configuration, you also set up a deposit. 

Okay, so I guess step two, if you actually use the recovery policies to lose your account, so I would recommend don't follow this step in general. But the idea is that if this happens, and it's uncontrollable, that because you set up a recovery configuration, you can go ahead and actually recover your account. 

So step three, is to initiate a recovery process. So it's important here to be transparent about the fact that this recovery palette does not actually give you your private key back that the result of this process is not that you like magically discover, you know the information that you had lost. Pretty much nothing can do that, what we can do basically is give another account access to make calls on behalf of your last account. And so the first thing you need to do to initiate the recovery process is to create a new account. And you need to fund this account with some money. That's enough to pay for initiating the recovery process. So again, similarly to creating recovery configuration, we can get deposit, if you want to start a recovery process, we also take a deposit from the user. And this serves two purposes, one for storing data, but to to also prevent malicious actors. 

And again, we'll talk about this at the very end. But you will have to, if you lost your account, let's say it has like you know, $100,000 in it some crazy amount of money, right? You may have to go ahead and pay like $100 to actually start this recovery process seems worth it overall. And all of these deposits that you place are all returned to you. So in the whole recovery process, the only thing you pay are transaction fees.

09:07
Okay, so then you need to initiate the recovery process. Basically, you go and you call this pallet, and you say, Hey, here's my last account. Here's my deposit. Let's start the recovery process. So next, you need to contact your friends to vouch for your recovery attempt. So this you had this list of friends, you need to go reach them whether it's on chain, if you have some cool pallets in your runtime or off chain, just giving them a phone call saying hey, I lost my key. You know, it's me, this is the information please vouch that this is a good recovery attempt. Okay, at least m of n need to approve. 

So this is what you configure. This is what you've basically required to access your account. And then you need to wait for the delay period to pass of course, right. And if all of this happens, you just claim your recovered account. It's that easy. At this point, you can now make calls with your loss account. So through this recovery palette We have a function which is called as recovered. And basically, because you went through the process, you claimed your account, 

So step four, once you've claimed your account, you're able to make calls, you actually want to clean up your old account. So again, we cannot give you back your old account, there's nothing we can really do to like, give you this private key that was lost. But what we can do is allow you to clean up, move data over and all the good. So the first thing you want to do is close the recovery process, you'll use the recovery palette to call itself using the other account. And you will close the unclosed recovery process and you'll get your deposit back. 

You also remove your recovery configuration, right so now no one else can recover your account, you'll also get your other deposit back great you have somebody then you what you can do is you can you know basically call all of the other modules doing things that you need to do cleaned up. So you can unbond your sticking positions, you can remove identity information, basically call any other pallets through them every pallet acting as this user. Finally, the last step probably in this process is just a transfer all your funds back. So you can use the recovery palette to call the balances palette to send funds from your old account to your new account. And what's nice is once you've sent all of your funds, and basically you have no more funds left, your account is totally cleaned up in the system. 

So we have an automatic hook, which basically cleans up everything, including this recovery. So once you've sent all the funds over recovery pilot, our method removes the link between your two accounts. And this account now is totally, you know, kind of gone in the wind. 

So let's look at the malicious record attempts. They still need to wait for the delay period, right. And so they got all of the things happening, but they still need to wait. And you as a person who can see things happening on the blockchain can see that someone else is recovering your account like you have access to that account, you can still see that someone else is recovering. So what can you do? You can just go ahead this is this is exactly how you, you're not me, right. 

So what you can do is just close the recovery process. So you can through the recovery palette, say, Hey, I have my account, I can prove it by making a transaction, I can call the recovery pilot and say close this recovery attempt. And I take the deposit from the user. So basically, people who are malicious trying to attack your account is like a honeypot for you, you just get to take their money that they put down to try to steal your account. 

And there's no way for them to steal your accounts, as long as you just check that the recovery attempt is not malicious. So additionally, if you have a bunch of friends who who approve the recovery attempts, they're probably not friends you want to keep so you can go and update your configuration change amount, right. But in general, all you really need to do to keep your account safe is check once every delay period, you can you can figure this delay period, but you check once every delay period, as long as there's no one trying to recover your account. You're good. Otherwise, if people are coming your account, just get the free money. It's awesome. 

So it's probably in general better to set a pretty long period here like even if you actually lost your key, waiting three months. It's kind of better than allowing a malicious act. To get like three days to access your account, I can even imagine that we have separation of accounts and we have like the stash accounts controller counselor kind of stuff, you might want to just set different configurations based off of what the account can do, right? So you can you can control this, it's up to you to determine, I imagine some people who have like, you know, all their life savings in some blockchain account maybe wants to set like one year, right, like waiting one year is not such a big deal. If you know, you can recover it, right, that's awesome. 

Specify a high threshold. So I'm threshold is another thing that you can control. So you can pick, you know, 100 friends and say the threshold is one. So what does that mean? Well, that means that any friend on your account can basically steal your account from you, right? If you pick only two as your threshold, any two of them can coordinate and attack your account, they can basically approve themselves and get in. So it's important to set a high threshold, such that, you know, people aren't able to easily get the approvals on your account. And furthermore, it's important to pick your friends wisely. So it's important to pick from a diverse set of friends. 

What's nice about this configuration is that you can always update your friends. So as life changes as time goes on, as you make new friends, as you get in fights with people as you break up or get married or divorced, whatever, you can update this friend list and make sure they stay up to date. 

So one of the things we didn't do in this recovery palette is keep your friends the secret. So right now that's all public information, it will probably wouldn't be so hard to add additional kind of obfuscation layers to keep your friends with secrets. But for simplicity, and I think one of the things, I have the biggest call, you know, simple and easy like one of the nice ways to keep something like this safe is to simplify the logic like to really keep things simple and easy to read. And so right now we have the friends list open, that might be something that you want to change. Also, the recovery process is currently public. This is obviously a way that you can verify like, hey, someone's trying to steal my account. But I can imagine a world where you might want the recovery process to be secret. So this could also be something you can modify or tweak if you want to make your own palette. And that also would make sense, you know, again, we talked about layers outside the blockchain, it might make sense to have a notification system. So like, you know, it'd be cool if I could set it for some service can email whenever someone tries to recover my account, and I can just be paying rather than having to go check all the time. So an offline system would be really awesome as kind of a wrapper to this whole project. Um, yeah, one more thing, 

20:24
clean up the old account if the new account can now act in its place? Yeah, so you could so you don't technically have to if you wanted to, you could forever use account be call recovery pallet, then call whatever you want to I, I haven't just gut feeling that doesn't doesn't sound very, like ergonomic in terms of like, I can't imagine many wallets will support it, I can't imagine a UI that will support it, I can't manage like, it won't be like a good experience for you as a user, right? It may be that the situation you're in and you can use the pallet that way, there's nothing stopping from using the pallet that way.


23:15
Yeah. So I think the comment here is that, you know, if you're if you really think you're like these two people are completely separate. You could have what, like 100 people total, and then you a threshold of 50. And then you can just kind of work on the one half or the other half and you contact all your friends and your family isn't like that. I don't know. You create like 50 imaginary keys that you add as your friends. Oh, right. I mean, your thrower. Yeah, okay. Yeah. So you can create other keys in chapter one. Actually, one more thing that you brought up, we were talking about this earlier today, which were very interesting to me was actually, you can use maybe some some kind of going back to what I was saying before this, just think about other ways that you can use our multisig and substrate in keeping safe. The utility palette, they have it here, due to the PA in addition to allowing you to do multi cigs also allows you to create sub accounts. And so you can imagine, if you want to do a multisig, where basically, one key is your account that you normally have access to another key is an account that your phone stores, you can basically create it to have a system on your substrate chain, right? Like you can basically say that, like I have a key on my computer, I have a key on my phone. And every time I want to sign a message, I use both to then access it. And so you basically create a to have a system on top of utility power. This is another way you can approach some kind of security practices around your account. It's kind of interesting. Yeah. Any other questions? Cool. Well, I think everyone should add this palette to their runtime and hopefully it will save your parents too from using the blockchain.
